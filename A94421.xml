            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat which (for the moſt part) em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldeneth men, to dedicate their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours unto any Perſonage, is the affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity between the matter of the Work which they preſent, and the Mind of him to whom it is preſented. I have here ſwerved from this cuſtom, being altogether too weak to preſent you with a Work, ſutable to your far more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parts: Yet when I conſidered my Deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſerve my Countrey, and to instruct the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, in this ſo excellent and neceſſary a <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> I thought none ſo fit to patronize and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb facs="tcp:115825:3"/> a piece of this nature, than one who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily deſires the publique good; which publique Spirit, and charitable Principle, I have (in a more than ordinary manner) obſerved in you; and your poor Neighbours (to their comfort) are daily ſenſible of. <hi>Sir,</hi> I need not tell you, how uſeful, a ſubject of this nature, may prove to the Commonalty, whoſe ignorance of their own condition, whileſt they are ſick, and want of ſtrength of body or purſe, to confer with a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, proves fatal to many a poor Christian in this Nation. I ſhall leave this to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Reader, and humbly crave your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable acceptance, of theſe my weak endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and Firſt-Fruits of my few years hard ſtudy: Which if I obtain; my Book, though a Stripling, and very impotent of it ſelf; yet under your favourable protection, I am confident, will manfully obvert and defend it ſelf againſt the venemous Bitings of Slanderous Tongues, from which it muſt expect not a little oppoſition. I hope, nay confidently believe that this poor Infant, though but meanly clad, will find your encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being an honeſt mans Child, no Vagrant. I beſeech you, <hi>Sir,</hi> excuſe my confidence, who dare thus ruſh into your preſence; and demand, without any merit of my own, your favourable protection.</p>

            <p>But it is your good Nature, of which I am an Admirer, that hath ſo far emboldened me.

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is not vain-glory (Courteous Reader) arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy or preſumption, that hath put me upon this Deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> publiſhing this Tractate of Phyſick: But for ſome years (having abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the hunting after all gliſtering ſhewes of happineſs) I have applyed my Mind to the ſtudy of Nature; and finding nothing in the World, that God, the Great Creatour, hath kept to himſelf, but made ſubject to the induſtrious Capacity of man's ſoaring Brain. And that the ſame God, that infuſed into man a conceiveable Mind, to underſtand the Myſteries of Nature; alſo gave a Tongue able to expreſs his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to another, and a Hand to write it for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Poſterity. As there is nothing can make a man approach nearer to the perfection of Nature, which he loſt in his Fall; then painful ſearching into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
<pb facs="tcp:115825:5"/> of Nature: ſo there is nothing in Nature can make a man more glorifie his Maker, then communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating what he hath found by Search and Induſtry, to Poſterity. Theſe conſiderations put me upon the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, not forgetting the ſaying of <hi>Plato,</hi> and the Stoicks, <hi>Non nobis ſolum nati ſumus, ortúſ<expan>
                     <am>

Quae in terris gignuntur, ad uſum hominum omnia creari, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines autem hominum cauſa eſſe generatos, ut ipſi inter ſe aliis alii prodeſſe poſſent:</hi> We are not born for our ſelves alone, but partly for our Countrey, partly for our Parents, and partly for our Friends: What ever the Earth hath produced, was created for the uſe of Man; Man alſo was created for Man's ſake, that they might among themſelves profit one by another. Theſe conſiderations (I ſay) moved me to purſue this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; which (though it will not ſatisfie every detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Critick, and ſelf-conceited Practitioner) I hope will find acceptance among thoſe, for whom I princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intended it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Courteous Reader,</hi> I have collected, out of the Works of moſt of the Ancient and Modern Phyſitians now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant among us, this Compendium or Abridgment of Phyſick, much of which I have ſealed, &amp; confirmed by the <hi>Probatum eſt</hi> of my own Experience, as Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath given me occaſion. I have not put thie to view, in competition with the Works of ſo many more grave and Learned Raboies; but for the good of thoſe that want ſuch helps, and are unacquainted with the Latine Tongue; but more particularly for theſe Reaſons:</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe many induſtrious Students have not a Purſe to purchaſe ſo many Authors. Secondly, others have not a Brain to peruſe ſuch lage Volumns; but are
<pb facs="tcp:115825:5"/> at firſt better able to apprehend much, lying in a little compaſs; the uſe of which (as an Introduction) will give them light to paſs thorough larger Volumes with more eaſe. Third'y, that People void of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and of mean Capacities, may be better able to judge of a Diſeaſe by the Symptomes, and give a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Information to an abſent Phyſitian, then to ſet him to juggle in the Piſs-per. Fourthly, Ladies and Gentlewomen, who are wont to help their poor ſick Neighbours, may be the better enabled, and be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned by dangerous Symptomes, to haſte to the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Phyſitian. Laſtly, that all Women may the better underſtand the Phyſitians Directions, and with more Prudence govern the Sick.</p>
            <p>The firſt Book was the Fruits of my wandering Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, which I once intended not for publick view. Much of the ſecond was my Daily Collections, which my Practiſe lead me to. In the Theory, I interlaced the Judgments of Authors, making choice of that which ſeemed moſt conſentaneous to Reaſon, and my own Experience. In the Practique part, I have quoted Medicines from ſeveral Authors, as left by them: Some I have ſomewhat altered, and that for two Reaſons: Firſt, ſome I have altered to make them more ſtrong and efficacious. Secondly, others I altered, when I was enforced to uſe (for want of one Ingredient) another of the ſame nature. This Book ſwelled to ſuch a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that I was forced to contract my ſelf in the two laſt, and to be ſomewhat briefer then I intended.</p>
            <p>Thus, courteous Reader, I have, for thy ſake, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my ſelf to the dangerous and ſharp Teeth of the envious Detractors, which is a great hazard, eſpecially in this poliſhed Age, among ſo many fine and curious Wits, who ſcarcely can approve of any thing, though
<pb facs="tcp:115825:6"/> never ſo judiciouſly compoſed. Yet if it find accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with thee, I have my end, and ſhall receive ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient encouragement, to undertake ſomewhat more for thy benefit: which I ſhall ſuddainly do, if I find this give content. If any fault, committed by my Pen, or the Preſs, paſs uncorrected, excuſe it. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it with a chearful heart; and as I freely impart, ſo do thou, what ever profit or knowledge thou gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thereby, freely for the good of thy Neighbour, to the honour of God, and praiſe of this Laudable Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and for the further encouraging of him who now is, farther to be</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>A Phyſicall Deſcription of Man.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe omnipotent and wiſe Creator, having created all things out of nothing, and out of a rude and undigeſted lumpe or maſſe (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will, and by his word) brought all things into a decent frame, and comely ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: out of a confuſed nothing wrought the Heaven and the Earth, out of that which was darke and voide he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated light, he ſeperated the Waters from the Earth, and gave bounds to the unruly waves; and indued the dry and barren Earth with a prolificall virtue, richly adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with graſſe, hearbs, and Fruit-Trees; he made the Sun, Moon, and Stars, to divide the light from the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to enlighten and rule both day and night, to be for ſignes, to diſtinguiſh ſeaſons, dayes and yeares; by his word he created every living thing that moveth in the Sea, and in the Earth. Having thus farr I ſay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his ſo excellent and admirable workmanſhip of Creation, he made Man, a Summary of the Worlds Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, a ſmall draught of the Divine Nature: he was made after other Creatures, not only as the moſt perfect, but as the ſuper-intendent &amp; maſter of all things created, <hi>Qui dominetur in piſces maris, et in volucres coeli, et in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cudes, &amp; in univerſam terram, atque in omnia reptilia, rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantia ſuper terram,</hi> to rule over the Fiſh of the Sea, and over the Foule of the Aire, and over the Cattle, and over the Earth, and over every Creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:115825:10"/>
               <p>In man he cloſed up, and ended his work; on man he ſtamped his Seal, and figne of his power, on him he hath imprinted his image and ſuperſcription, his armes and his portraiture. <hi>Dixit deus, Faciamus hominem ad imaginem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtram, ſecundum ſimilitudinem noſtram,</hi> God ſaid; Let us make man in our image, after our likneſſe: In the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of man, God ſeemeth to deliberate and take Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell with himſelfe, how to epitomize, and gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all his works in ſo ſmall a compaſſe, to contract his (ſo large) book of Creation, into ſo ſmall a volume.</p>
               <p>He is called the <hi>Microcoſm,</hi> or little World, the reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation of all things, the ligament of Angels &amp; Beaſts, Heavenly and Earthly, ſpirituall and corporall things: the perfection of the whole work, the honour and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of nature. He created him naked, being a pure neat and delicate Creature, made up of thin, ſubtill, well tempered and ſeaſoned humours; innocent, and far more beautifull than the reſt. He was created upright, but-little touching the Earth; quite oppoſite to the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Plant, whoſe root is therein fixed; far different alſo from the beaſt, who is a meane between a Plant and himſelfe, and goeth downward; his two extreames tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bounds of the Horizon: This upright gate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth only unto man, as the holieſt, and moſt Divine Creature, his head tending to the Heavens, on which he looks, and there beholds himſelfe as in a glaſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>Ovid.</hi>

               <p>His body being thus formed of pure, ſubtill Earth, as a houſe and habitation for the Soul, God breathed in him the breath of Life, and he became a living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: So in the ordinary generation, and formation, which is made of the ſeed in the Womb, nature obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the ſelfe ſame order; the body is firſt formed, as well by the Elementary force which is in the ſeed, and the heat of the matrix; as by the Celeſtiall influence of the Sun: according to the Adagy, <hi>Sol &amp; homo generant hominem,</hi> the Sun and Man do engender man: which is don (according to the opinion of moſt) in ſuch order, that the firſt ſeaven dayes the ſeed of the man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, mingle and curdle like cream, which is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of conception: The ſecond ſeaven days, the ſeed is changed into a formleſſe bloody ſubſtance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted into a thick and indigeſted maſſe of fleſh, the proper matter of the Child. The next ſeaven days, out of this Lump is produced and faſhioned a groſſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with the three moſt noble parts, <hi>viz:</hi> the Liver, Heart, and Braine. The fourth ſeaven days or neare thirty, the whole body is ended, perfected, joynted, and organized, and becometh a body fit to entertaine the ſoul, which inveſts it ſelfe into the body (as ſome think) about the ſeaven and thirtieth or fourtieth day: at the third month, or there abouts, the Infant hath motion and ſenſe; at the ninth Month, is brought forth. Theſe times cannot be ſo exactly prefixed, but that by the ſtrength or debility of the ſeed, or matrix, it may

               <p>Man for whom all things was made, is nouriſhed by the <hi>Balſamick</hi> Spirits of Vegetables Animals and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls; and therefore doth conſiſt of all theſe faculties, that ſpring up as a token of health or ſickneſſe: Balme, Violets, and Germander, produce fruit in man, <hi>viz:</hi> the

               <head>CAAP. III. <hi>A Deſcription of the Head.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Head of a man ſeemeth to offer it ſelfe, as the firſt thing to be conſidered; it doth poſſeſſe the higheſt place in the body, and repreſents the uppermoſt, and Angelicall region: It is the fort of mans mind, the ſeat of reaſon, the habitation of Wiſdome, the ſhop of memory, judgment, and cogitations. It containeth the Braine, cold and ſpongeous by nature, encloſed with two skinns, the one more hard and thick, joyning it ſelfe to the Braine Pan, called <hi>Dura mater;</hi> the other more thin and eaſie, wherein lieth the Braine encloſed, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>pia mater;</hi> it is ſoft and tender to the Braine, and nouriſheth it, as a loving mother doth her yong and tender Babe, From <hi>Pia mater,</hi> doth iſſue the ſinews and marrow that deſcendeth and falleth down into the Reines of the Back. In the Brain, is the ſeat and throne of the rationall Soul, in which are a very great number of Veins and Arteries planted, rameſying (or branching) themſelves through all the ſubſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, adminiſtring to the Brain, both Spirit and Life,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115825:12"/> vitall and nutrimentall nouriſhment, which is raiſed, by the aforeſaid ſmall Veines and Arteries, from the Heart and Liver: and concocted, and reconcocted, ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated, and made very ſubtill, paſſing through thoſe woven and interlaced, turning and winding paſſages, in which labyrinth the Vitall Spirit often pas;ſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing, is perfected and refined, and becomes ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall.</p>
               <p>It is not loſt labour if we conſider, how the <hi>pia mater</hi> divideth the ſubſtance of the Braine, and lappeth it into certaine Cells or Diviſions; viz: the ſubſtance of the Braine is devided into three ventricles, of which the foremoſt containeth the moſt, the middlemoſt leſſe, the hindermoſt the leaſt. In the foremoſt part of the braine imagination is ſeated: in the middlemoſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the hindermoſt memory: imagination is hot and dry in quality, quick and active, from whence it commeth that Frantick men, and ſuch as are ſick of hot and burning maladaies, are excellent in that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to imagination: many upon ſuch a diſtemper have been excellent in poetry and divination; It never ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, alwaies working, whether the man be ſleeping or waking; and by the vapours that come from the Heart, formes variety of cogitations, which, wanting the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of judgment, (when man ſteepeth) becomes a dream.</p>
               <p>Hence it appeareth that ſubtilty, promtitude, and that which they commonly call Wit, belongeth to a hot imagination. It is active, ſtiring, undertaketh all, and ſetteth all the reſt to work, it gathereth the kinds and figures of things; both preſent, by the ſervice of the five ſenſes; and abſent, by the Common ſenſe.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:115825:13"/>
               <p>Judgment is ſeated in the midſt of the braine, there to beare rule over the other faculties, it is the judge of the little World, the ſeat of the rationall ſoul, and the judge of mens actions. If you would know the mean, whereby it knoweth and judgeth of things, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and many others have thought that the Spirit knoweth by the help of the ſenſes, and that the underſtanding without the ſenſes is but as white Paper. <hi>Nil eſt in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectu, quod non fucritprius in ſenſu.</hi> There is nothing in the underſtanding, which is not firſt in the ſenſe.</p>
               <p>This opinion is falſe, becauſe the ſeeds of ſcience, and virtue are inſinuated into our Spirits: elſe is the ſtate of the reſonable ſoul, worſe then the vegetative or ſenſitive which of themſelves are able to exerciſe their functions. It were abſurd to think that ſo noble and Divine a facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhould beg aſſiſtance, of ſo vile and corruptible as the ſenſes, which apprehend only the ſimple accidents, not the natures nor eſſence of things. Againe, were it ſo, it muſt follow, that they that have their ſenſes moſt perfect, ſhould be moſt witty; whereas we many times ſee the contrary.</p>
               <p>Yet let no man think, that the Spirit hath no ſervice from the ſenſes: for in the beginning, diſcovery, and invention of things, the ſenſes do much ſervice to the Spirit: but the Spirit dependeth not upon the ſenſes.</p>
               <p>Some are of opinion, that it is hot and moiſt in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, others ſay, that a dry temperature is proper to the underſtanding, whereby it comes to poſſe, that aged perſons excell thoſe, in underſtanding, that are young, becauſe as yeares increaſe, moiſture doth decreaſe in the braine: hence it comes to paſſe that melancolique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that are afflicted with want, and faſt much, are wiſe and ingenious; for heavineſſe and faſting are great driers: <hi>Splendor ſiccus, animus ſapientiſſimus: vexatio
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115825:13"/> dat intellectum,</hi> heat and drouth reſineth the witt, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on giveth underſtanding: &amp; that is the reaſon that great perſons, that feed highly, and take little care, and ſeldom lie under vexation or affliction, for the moſt part are none of the wiſeſt. Beaſts that are of a dry temperature, as Ants, Bees, Elephants, &amp;c: are wiſe and ingenious: on the contrary they that are of a moiſt conſtitution, are ſtupid, and without Spirit, as are Swine. Memory is ſeated in the hinder cell of the braine, as the grand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countant, or regiſter of the little world, whoſe office is to record things paſt, preſent, or to come. Some ſay its temperature is cold and dry, and that is the reaſon that melancolique people have good memoryes; others that it is moſt, becauſe Children have better memories then old men: Men are more apt for memory in the morning by reaſon of the moiſture gained by ſleep in the night: the common people do more eſteeme of memory, and delight more in it than of the other two; it maketh a great ſhew in the world, and they judge thoſe that have a good memory to be very wiſe; eſteeming more of ſcience, then of wiſdome; but of the three it is the leaſt, and that which ſooles do many times enjoy, for ſeldom is an excellent memory joyned with underſtanding and wiſdom: for their temperatures are contrary: hence comes that ill courſe in the inſtructing of youth, viz: to make them have by heart all they learn: and ſo ſtuffe &amp; gorge memory with other mens good, and ſtarve the underſtanding. We ſee thoſe that have all <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> in their heads, yet are the verieſt ſots in in the world.</p>
               <p>Many have been very excellent in this faculty, <hi>Seneca</hi> repeated 2000 names as they were firſt ſpoken; he alſo hearing 200 verſes, rehearſed them, and began at the laſt. <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> knew every Souldiers name in their Armys. <hi>Mithridates</hi> learned the language of two and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115825:14"/> twenty Nations: <hi>Eſdras</hi> the Prieſt had the whole Jewiſh doctrine by heart. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> would dictate to four at the ſame time: and that which is more ſtrange, <hi>Pliny</hi> would dictate to one, heare an other, and read at that inſtant. As theſe were ſo excellent and acute in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, others were as dull: <hi>Atticus</hi> could never learne the letters of the Alphabet by heart: others could not count above four: It is ſaid, that <hi>Theodore Beza</hi> two yeares before he dyed, as he languiſhed, his mind grew ſo Feeble that he forgat things preſent, yet held thoſe things, which were printed in his mind before time, when his underſtanding and memory was good. What ſhall we ſay of <hi>Meſſala Corvinus;</hi> who forgat his own name? Or <hi>Franciſcus Barbarus</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> a very learned man in the Greek tongue, having received a blow on his head with a ſtone, forgat his learning, which he had ſpent the greateſt part of his time upon, yet remembred all things elſe? Theſe things are brought to paſſe (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt) either by the ſtrength or debility of mens ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitures, and from directions, and accidents thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. Witt and underſtanding, and all the faculties of the ſoul depends on a certaine temperament: and hence it comes to paſſe (and that oftentimes) that thoſe that are acute, and wiſe in ſome things, are ſtupid and dull in other ſome.

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of the parts belonging to the Head.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAving given you a briefe and generall deſcription of the Head, and of the intellective faculty of man; it is meet now to treat of the ſenſitive part, which will lead me to deſcribe the particular parts of the head.</p>
               <p>The ſenſitive faculty hath its reſidence in the <hi>pia ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> it is that which gives virtue to all the particular ſenſes, and keeps a harmony among them: they are five in number, <hi>viz:</hi> Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Taſting, Feeling: Although theſe are all united in one in the braine, yet operatively they are diſtinguiſhed in their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſeats, and places of reſidence.</p>
               <p>The ſight reſides in the eyes, and particularly in the Cryſtalline humor, they are two in number, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterall, planted in the higheſt ſtage as <hi>Centinells,</hi> they are the luminaties of the <hi>Microcoſm; Galen</hi> ſaith, the braine and the head were made for the eye, that they might be in the higheſt as a beholder in a Tower, they are next in nature unto the Soul; for in the eye is ſeen and known the diſturbances and griefes, gladneſſe and joys of the Soul, as Love, Wrath, and other Paſſions; they be compounded and made of ſeaven Tunicles or Coats, and three humours, they proceed out of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the braine, and comes through the <hi>pia mater,</hi> of whoſe ſubſtance they take a panicle, to defend it from annoyance. They meet and are united into one ſinew, about halfe an inch in length, before they enter the skull, and after divided into two, each goeth into one eye, they are called <hi>Nervi Optici,</hi> the Optick Nerves, and through theſe, are brought the viſible Spirits to the eye. Theſe are the moſt noble outward parts of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115825:15"/> body, in beautie, utilitie, mobilitie, &amp; activity. They are to the viſage, that which the viſage is to the body, they are the face of the face; and becauſe they are tender, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and pretious, they are fenced and rampaird on all ſides, with skins, lids, brows, and haire. The object of the eye or ſight is colour (according to the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) which is an adherent quality in bodyes, whereof there are ſix ſimple, as white, yellow, red, purple, green, and blew: the compounds are infinite; to ſpeak more fully, the true object is light; which is never without colour, and without which the colours are inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>The ſenſe of Seeing excelleth all the reſt in many things; it apprehendeth farther off, and extendeth it ſelfe even to the Starrs. It is certainly reported, that <hi>Strabo</hi> had ſuch acute eyes, that from <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> he could diſcerne ſhips, going forth of the <hi>Carthagenian</hi> Haven, and could number them, the diſtance was 135. miles. It hath more variety of objects, for to all things and generally in all, there is light and colour the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the eys, as I hinted before. It is moſt exquiſite; for it is moſt exact, in the leaſt &amp; fineſt things that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelfe. It is more prompt and ſudden, for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth even in a moment and without motion, when the other ſenſes require motion and time. It en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth a liberty incomparable to others: the eye ſeeth, or ſeeth not, and therefore hath lids to open or ſhut: it is active, all the reſt purely paſſive. But that which is moſt noble in this ſenſe is, that the privation of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereof, which is darkneſſe, brings feare and that naturally, becauſe then a man findeth himſelfe robbed of ſo excellent a guide: the ſight, in the light, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of company, wherein man much delighteth.</p>
               <p>It would fill a large volume, to deſcribe the Eye in every perticular, but that which I have ſaid thereof, is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115825:15"/> ſufficient, it being not my taske to write an Anatomy. Hearing is the next ſenſe to be conſidered, whoſe reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is in the eares, it is in quality cold and dry, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of <hi>Saturn.</hi> They are placed on the outſide of the head, in the ſelfe ſame hight as the eyes are, as the Scouts of the body, Porters of the Spirit, the Receivers and Judgers of the ſounds, which alwayes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend. They have their entrance oblique and crooked, that ſo the ſound may not enter all at once, whereby the ſenſe of hearing might be hindred, and not ſoe well able to judge: and againe that the ſounds being fugitive, might there lurke, and abide under his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, till the inſtruments of hearing hath gotten poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion thereof. The Sinews that are the organs of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſpring each from the braine, and when they come to the hole of the Eare, they are writhed together; the end is like a worme or little teat, into which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſound, and from thence carried, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon witts to diſtinguiſh. The object of the eare or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a ſound, or noiſe proceeding from the encounter of two bodyes: A pleſant and melodious ſound ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and appeaſeth the Spirit, conſequently the body too, and drives maladies from them both: the ſharp and penetrant, doth trouble and wound the Spirit. This ſenſe hath many ſingularities; for the ſervice of the body, the ſight is moſt neceſſary, but for the Spirit, hearing hath the ſuperiority. It is ſpirituall, the agent of underſtanding: many that have been blind, have been great and wiſe Philoſophers, but never any that were deafe. In briefe, ſcience, truth, and virtue, hath no other entrance into the Soul, but by the eare. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity teaches that if faith cometh by hearing, which the fight doth tather hurt then help. Faith is the beliefe of thoſe things, which are not ſeen; which beliefe is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by hearing. For all theſe reaſons and many
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115825:16"/> more that might be inſerted, the wiſeſt have ſo much commended Hearing, the pure guardian from all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; the health of the inward man,</p>
               <p>Smelling is ſeated in the Noſe, governed by <hi>Mars,</hi> and is hot and dry in quality; and therefore Martiall Creatures, or ſuch as are hot and dry of conſtitution, excell in this faculty, as Doggs, &amp;c: From the braine commeah two Sinews to the holes of the braine pan, where beginneth the concavity of the Noſe, and theſe two are the proper Organs or Inſtruments of ſmelling, they have heads like paps, into which is received the virtue of ſmelling, and preſenting it to the common ſenſe. Over theſe two Organs, is placed <hi>Colatorium,</hi> or the noſtrills, which concavity or ditch was made for two cauſes; firſt that the aire, that bringeth the Spirit of ſmelling, might reſt therein, till it were received by its proper Organs. Secondly that the excrements of the Brain might be hidden under it, till it be fitt to be ejected. From this concavity goeth two holes into the mouth, of which we may take notice of three conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: Firſt that when a mans mouth is cloſed, either by eating or ſleeping, that then the aire might come through them to the Lungs: elſe a man muſt be forced to hold his mouth open alwaies. Secondly they are helpfull to a mans ſpeech, for when one or both of thoſe paſſages are ſtopped, a man ſpeaketh in the Noſe, as we commonly ſay. Thirdly, they are uſefull in the cleanſing of the concavities of the noſe, either by ſnuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or drawing it through the mouth. The object of Smell is an odour, or ſent, which is a fume riſing from an odoriferous object, aſcending to the noſe, to the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles of the braine: the ſtrong and violent hurteth the braine, the temperate and good, doth rejoyce, delight and comfort. This ſenſe is oftentimes very uſefull, in diſcovering meats or drinks of an evill odour, which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115825:16"/> otherwiſe would much prejudice the ſtomach, and work evill effects in the body of man.</p>
               <p>Much more might be ſaid, touching the ſhape and forme, matter and compoſition of the Noſe, but my deſigne is to diſtinguiſh the parts in a generall way.</p>
               <p>The Taſte is hot and moiſt, and under the influence of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> this Senſe hath its reſidence in the pallat of the mouth, and tongue. Its office is to diſcerne what food is congruous to the ſtomach, and what not. The skin of the palate of the mouth is the ſame, with the inward part of the ſtomach; and the ſame with the way of the meat into the ſtomack; and hence it cometh to paſſe, that when a man is touched upon the Pallat of the mouth, it tickleth the ſtomach, and ſo much the nearer to the throat, ſo much more the ſtomach abhorreth. The object of Taſting is a ſavour or ſmack, whereof there are ſix ſimple kinds; as Sweet, Sowre, Sharp, Tart, Salt, Bitter; the compounds are many. And being led to the mouth, it is not a miſſe, if I ſpeak a few words to the compoſition thereof. In the mouth, are five parts to be conſidered; the Lips, the Teeth, the Tongue, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vula, the Pallat of the mouth; of the which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken: A word or two of the reſt. The lips are made of a muſculous fleſh, their office is, firſt, as the doore to the Houſe to keep the mouth cloſe, till the meat be chewed, Secondly they help to pronounce the ſpeech. The Teeth the hardeſt members, faſtned into the mandible; their office is firſt to grind the meat before it goeth into the ſtomack, that ſo it may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter digeſt; Secondly, that it might be a help to the ſpeech, for they that want any of their Teeth are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective therein. The number is uncertaine, ſome have more, ſome have leſſe; they, who have their full num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber have thirty and two. The tongue is a carnuous member, compound and made of many Nerves, Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115825:17"/> Veins and Arteries, ordained principally for three cauſes: Firſt that when a man eateth, the tongue might turne the meat, in the mouth, till it be chewed. Secondly by the Tongue, and the Pallat of the mouth neer the root of the tongue, is received the taſt of ſweet or ſower, and thence preſented to the common ſenſes to paſſe judgment thereof. Thirdly and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally the tongue is ordained for the pronunciation of ſpeech, of which faculty I muſt crave leave to inſiſt on, and that as briefly as may be. Speech is an excellent preſent, and very neceſſary; given only unto man, <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi index &amp; ſpeculum:</hi> it is the interpreter and image of the ſoul; the hearts meſſenger: the gate, through which doth paſſe all that lyeth within the darke and hidden corners of man; by this the Spirit becomes viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Of all the externall and viſible parts of the body that, which cometh neareſt to the heart is the root ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; &amp; that which cometh neereſt the thoughts is ſpeech, <hi>Out of the aboundance of the Heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> It is a powerfull Mafter, an Imperious Commander; it ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up, animateth, exaſperateth, appeaſeth, maketh ſad, merry, it imprinteth what ever paſſion it handleth: feedeth the ſoul of the hearer; it maketh him bluſh, wax pale, laugh, cry, tremble, mad with choler, leap for joy, what not? It is the great huckſter, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medler, by it we traffick, peace is handled, affaires are managed, it is the band of humane ſociety: hearing and ſpeech anſwer, and are accommodated the one to the other: by theſe two the ſouls are poured the one into the other: ſo that if theſe two gates be ſhut, (as it is in thoſe that are deaſe and dumbe) the Spirit remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſolitary and miſerable. Hearing is the gate to enter; by it the Spirit receiveth all things from without: ſpeech is the gate to go out, through it the Spirit ſendeth forth that which was within. From the communication of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115825:17"/> theſe two, as from the ſtroke of two flints, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth the fire of truth; and ſo by the poliſhing and rubbing of theſe two, knowledge cometh to perfection. But Hearing is the firſt and principall, for there can nothing come forth, which hath not firſt entered; and therefore he that is deaſe altogether by nature, is alſo dumbe.</p>
               <p>I might much more enlarge my ſelfe in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Head: but my purpoſe being to declare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what may be pertinent in the manifeſtation of the humaine faculties and virtues; I ſhall conclude this Chapter with a word or two of the ſenſe of Feeling which is of no particular quality, but of all, hot, cold, dry and moiſt, it is deputed to no particular Organ, but is ſpread abroad over the whole body: it is the Index of all tangible things: its object then muſt be heat or cold, dryth or moiſture; things pleaſant and polite, ſharp and ſmatting, motion, reſt, tickling. It is well known that man, and other Creatures live without ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſenſe; It is the opinion of moſt, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live without this ſenſe of Feeling, being only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary unto life: yet <hi>Auguſtine</hi> proveth the contrary, in the 14. book <hi>de Civitate dei;</hi> by example of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that lay as though he were dead, and did not feele thoſe, that pulled him, nor would he ſtirre, though they burned him with fire, yet he confeſſed that he could then he are men ſpeak, (if they ſpake aloud) as though they were far from him; by which it appeares, that this he did, not by reſiſting, but for want of the ſenſe of feeling which afterward was reſtored to him againe: I ſhall paſſe by, what the Engliſh Hiſtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of one <hi>Elizabeth Barton,</hi> a maid of <hi>Canterbury</hi> who oftentimes was deprived of her ſenſes, by reaſon of a diſeaſe ſhe had.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:115825:18"/>
               <p>I ſhall alſo wave diſputes, concerning the number of the ſenſes, ſome ſuppoſing there are no more in nature then are apparent in us. There may very well be more, yet greatly to be doubted that there are; it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us to know them, to affirme them, or to deny them, becauſe a man ſhall never know the want of that ſenſe, which he never had, one ſenſe cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover another; and if a man want one by nature, yet he knows not which way to affirme it. A man that is born blind, and hath not heard what ſight is; cannot conceive that he ſeeth not, nor deſire to ſee. So man, being not able to imagine more then the five that he hath, cannot know how to judge, whether there be more in nature, who knoweth whether the difficulties, that we find in many of the works of nature; and the effects of many Creatures, which we cannot underſtand, do proceed from the want of ſome ſenſe that we have not? There are hidden properties, which we ſee in many things; and a man may ſay that there are ſenſible faculties in nature, proper to judge, and apprehend them, yet muſt conclude, we have them not: who knoweth whether it be ſome particular ſenſe, that diſcovereth the houre of midnight to the Cock, and moves him to crow; or how beaſts are taught, to chooſe certaine heaths for their cure, and many ſuch like wonders? None can affirme or deny, ſay, This it is, or that it is.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of the Stomach and its faculties.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Stomach is a member, compound and Sperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, Sinewy and ſenſible, wherein is made the perfect firſt digeſtion of <hi>Chile;</hi> It is a neceſſary member to the body, for if it ſaile in lts operation, the whole Fabrick is corrupted. It is in the little world, the ſame as the terreſtriall Globe is in the great world: In it, is expreſſed the ſublunary part of the world; in it, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the parts that ſerve for nutrition, concoction, and procreation. And this leads me to diſcourſe of the adminiſtring vertues in man, which are here ſeated; and to wind up all with a touch of the office of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſmicall</hi> Stars, with as much brevitie as may be. The Stomach is framed of two pannicles, the outer is <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,</hi> the inner <hi>Nerveous,</hi> from which is ſtretched to the mouth <hi>Iſofagus,</hi> or the way of the meat, by which the ſtomach draweth to it ſelfe meat, and drink, as with hands. By the virtue of the ſubtill will, which is in this <hi>Muſculus Longitudinall,</hi> is made the attractive vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: which is hot and dry; by a quality active, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, which appeares by the Sun, the Fountaine of all heat, which is of an attractive quality, which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by his attracting, and exhaling the humidity from this inferiour Globe, into the airy region, as into the neck or higher part of an <hi>Alimbeck;</hi> and being reſolved into water, (by reaſon of their weight) fall down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine upon the earth, which is the veſſel receiving: So through continued diſtillations, by ſublimation of the water, by cohobation; by drawing of the liquor, being often powred on, and fortified by the influence of the Celeſtiall, and Centrall Sun, the body becomes indued,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115825:19"/> with a concoctive, nutritive, and procreative virtue. So in the Stomach, by the active qualitie of the <hi>Microcoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall</hi> Sun, his benevolent rayes, and freindly heat, meat and drink is deſired, and attracted into the ſtomach, for the nouriſhment of the whole body.</p>
               <p>We can do no leſſe then give <hi>Mars</hi> a ſhare in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the attractive faculty, being hot and dry by nature, this is reaſon: experience telleth us that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall men, or men of a Cholerick conſtitution, are none of the worſt trencher-men; and at the pot incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>In the Stomach is a <hi>Tranſverſe Muſcle,</hi> to withhold or make retention: by this retentive virtue, thoſe things that are brought into the Stomach, are kept and withholden, untill nature hath wrought his kind, and every faculty hath executed his office. It is in quality cold and dry, cold becauſe the nature of cold is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, or hold together, as you may ſee in Ice: dry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the nature of drineſſe, to keep and hold what is compreſſed. It is under the influence of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and that is the reaſon, why, for the moſt part, men that are cold and dry of temperature, or, as Aſtrologers ſay, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnine</hi> people, are covetous and tenacious: and that is the reaſon, that old men, are naturally covetuous, becauſe <hi>Saturn</hi> ruleth old age; and by the decay of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the temperature becomes cold and dry.</p>
               <p>It hath the Spleen, the repreſentative of <hi>Saturn,</hi> lying toward the left ſide, and furniſheth the Stomach, with humours neceſſary to fortifie the retentive vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>The digeſtive faculty, (which is the chiefe and moſt principall, (the other, like hand-Maids, attending it) is hot and moiſt; Natures, Cooke, and principall work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the <hi>Archaeus,</hi> and centrall fire, which in this Philoſophicall Veſſell, <hi>viz:</hi> the Stomach, digeſteth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115825:19"/> the victualls into a <hi>Chaos,</hi> or confuſed Maſſe, that ſo a naturall ſeparation may be made. It is under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who furniſheth it with freindly heat and moiſture, by the Liver, (the <hi>Microcoſmicall Jupiter</hi>) cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and beating the right ſide of the Stomach.</p>
               <p>The Stomach hath alſo a Latitudinall Muſcle or will, which makes the expulſive faculty: It is naturally cold &amp; moiſt, cold to compreſſe the ſuperfluity, moiſt to make the matter ſlippery and fit for ejection, alſo to work a ſutable diſpoſition in the body. It is a neceſſary operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by it, after the ſeperation of the pure from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, the Elements from the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> or rather <hi>foeces;</hi> is removed, and carried away all that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe or prejudiciall to nature. It is under the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Moon, (with whom you may joyne <hi>Venus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame nature) whoſe <hi>Epitome,</hi> or <hi>Microcoſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſubſtitute,</hi> viz: the braine, ſendeth a branch of Nerves to the Stomach, and thereby furniſheth it with humours cold and moiſt, fit for expulſion.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now haſten, to give you a ſhort deſcription of the Heart, Liver, Spleen, and Kidneys, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the Heart.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Now come to ſpeak breifly of the Heart, who is the principall of all other members, and the beginning of life, he is ſet in the mid'ſt of the Breaſt, by himſelfe as Lord and King of all the Members. And, as a Lord or King ought to be ſerved of his ſubjects, that have their living of him; ſo are all the Members of the body, ſubjects of the Heart: they receive their living from him, and in many wayes they do him ſervice. He is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115825:20"/> the ſame in the little world, as the Sun that glorious Lampe of Heaven is in the great world. It is called <hi>Sol Corporis,</hi> as the Sun is called <hi>Cor Coeli,</hi> becauſe their operations are ſo like. The vitall Spirit hath its reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence here; why then ſhould antiquity with <hi>ignominy</hi> be brought to the Barr, and condemned, for ſaying the Heart lives firſt, and dyes laſt: he being the Fountaine and beginning of life, it muſt needs follow, that it is the firſt thing in man that lives, and the laſt that dyes.</p>
               <p>Here is to be noted that the heart hath blood in his ſubſtance, whereas all other members have it in their Veines and Arteries. It is bound to the back part of the breaſt by certaine Ligaments, which Ligaments though they touch not the ſubſtance of the Heart; yet in the over part they ſpring forth of him; By which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to be King of the members, and Center of the <hi>Mocrocoſmicall</hi> planetary <hi>Hiarchy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover the Heart hath two Ventricles or Concavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the left is higher than the right; the cauſe of its hollowneſſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to keep the blood for his nouriſhing: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e to abate and temper the great heat which is included, and ſhut up in the Concavityes.</p>
               <p>As he is <hi>Sol Corporis,</hi> and Center of the reſt of the members, and ruler of the family, he communicates to them Life and Motion: yet by his heat he attracts what is needfull for himſelfe, from the other members as a ſubſidy or tax impoſed upon his ſubjects. And therefore to the right Ventricle of the Heart, cometh a Veine from the great Veine called <hi>Venakells,</hi> which receiveth all the ſubſtance of the blood from the Liver; this Veine I ſay paſſeth from Venakelis to the right ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart, and bringeth a great portion of the thickeſt and pureſt blood to nouriſh the Heart. The reſidue that is left of this, is made more ſubtill through
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115825:20"/> the virtue and heat of the Heart, and then ſent into a concavitie or pit in the midſt of the Heart, between the two Ventricles: therein it is made more hot, and pure; and from thence it paſſeth to the beſt Ventricle, and there is engendred in it a Spirit, that is clearer, brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſubtiller, then any Corporeall or bodily thing, which is engendered of the four Elements; for it is a mean between the Body and the Soul: Wherefore of the Philoſophers it is likned more to heavenly than earthly things.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall taket leave to digreſſe, and tell you of ſome things wonderfull, touching the Heart: If we credit <hi>Avicenna.</hi> Some have wanted a Heart: and to this purpoſe I could recite other mens opinions; but I ſhall not trouble the readers head with ſuch things, which ſeem to my ſelfe impoſſible. <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> ſpeaketh of one <hi>Ariſtomanes Meſſenius,</hi> who killed 300. <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who had a hairy Heart. <hi>Beneventus</hi> reports the ſame of a certaine thiefe. <hi>Columbus</hi> obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a young man that wanted the pericardium, (which is a thin skin involving the Heart as in a purſe) and he was much troubled with ſwoonding fits. It hath been the opinion, that a man cannot live a moment ſcarſely, who hath received a wound in the Heart: And good reaſon too, ſeeing the life depends upon the ſafety of the Spirits, the Heart being the ſhop and making there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; when the Heart is wounded, it is neceſſary that the generation of the Spirits ceaſe. Yet <hi>Nicol. Malerius</hi> relates a Hiſtory of one <hi>Andreas Haſevanger,</hi> who was one of the Lifeguard of Count <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Friſia, &amp;c.</hi> who received a wound in the Breaſt by his fellow Souldier, <hi>Anno</hi> 1607. on the 22 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the evening, and died the 8th. of <hi>Septemper</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one houre after Sunriſing; his body being opened to ſearch for the wound, by the aforenamed <hi>Nicol. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius,</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:115825:21"/> and two other Chirurgions, in the preſence of ſeverall Souldiers of note; they found that the wound had entered the right cavity of the Heart, and that part of the Heart was almoſt conſumed; the left part remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entire, which is the cheife habitation of the vitall ſpirits. By this meanes he lived 16 dayes, which had been imposſible; if the left ventricle had been wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>But to proceed; from the left Ventricle of the Heart, ſpringeth two Arteries, the one having but one Coat, and therefore is called <hi>Arteria Venalis,</hi> which carryeth blood from the Heart to the Lungs, which blood is vaporous, and fit for its nouriſhment; and carrieth back aire from the Lungs to refreſh the Heart,</p>
               <p>See here the Harmony and freindly Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Microcoſmicall</hi> Sun and <hi>Mercury;</hi> the firſt affordeth of his own nutriment to nouriſh the other, whilſt the other rewards him with aire to refreſh him. The other Arterie hath two Coats, it is called <hi>Vena Arterialis,</hi> or the great <hi>Arterie,</hi> of which ſpringeth all the other Arteries, that ſpread to every member of the body, which carieth the Spirits, which are the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Souls virtue. Thus it paſſeth till it come to the braine, and be made an animall Spirit, as you have heard before in the third Chapter; at the Liver it is made nutrimentall; and at the Teſticles generative. Thus by the Heart is made a Spirit of every kind, and (like the Sun in the Heavens) by his royall preſence, he doth conferre life and liberty to his ſuppliants.</p>
               <p>I might here tell you, why theſe Arteries have two coats, namely becauſe one is not ſufficient, to withhold the vitall Spirits, carried in them, their motion being ſo violent. Againe the thing carried about being ſo precious a treaſure, it had need of the better keeping. This Arterie is called the pulſative Veine. <hi>I</hi> might
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115825:21"/> here frame a large diſcourſe of the pellicles of the Heart, which open and ſhut to receive the blood: Alſo the two little eares by whom commeth in and paſſeth out the aire: I might ſay much of the pannicles, which as ſome think have their originall from <hi>dura mater,</hi> as namely, <hi>pericardium,</hi> called of ſome <hi>Capſula Cordis,</hi> which ſpringeth of the upper pannicle of the Midriffe, and covereth the Heart: of the which ſpringeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called <hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi> which parteth the breaſt in the mid'ſt, and keepeth that the Lungs fall not over the Heart, (ſuch a rule, hath the Architect Spirit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to each part (as Starrs to move in their ſeverall Orbs) There is another pannicle that covereth the ribs, of whom the Midriffe taketh its beginning. But this being beyond my intended ſcope, I will put an end to this Chapter of the Heart.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of the Lungs, Liver, &amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Lungs is made of a ſubſtance very ſoft and ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous; ſupple, to draw and to inforce from, like a paire of bellows: it is an inſtrument of reſpiration, whereby the heart is refreſhed, drawing unto it the blood, the Spirits and the aire, and disburthening it ſelfe of thoſe fumes and excrements, which oppreſſe it, It is naturally cold and dry, accidentally cold and moiſt: naturally cold and dry waying about the Heart, abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his beat, by its refreſhing blaſt; it is accidentally moiſt, by reaſon of <hi>Catarhs</hi> and <hi>Rhewmes,</hi> which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth from the Braine.</p>
               <p>There are three principall parts in the Lungs conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, one is a Veine coming from the Liver, which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115825:22"/> bringeth with it, the crude and undigeſted part of the Chile to feed the Lungs. Another is <hi>Arteria Venialis,</hi> coming from the Heart, bringing the Spirit of life to nouriſh the Lungs. The third is <hi>Trachia Arteria,</hi> that bringeth aire to the Lungs, and it paſſeth through all the left part of them to do its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
               <p>The Lungs is divided into the five portions or pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, three on the right ſide, and two on the left ſide; if in caſe any impediment or hurt ſhould happen any in one part, the other ſhould be ready to ſupply the office.</p>
               <p>But I forbeare any further deſcription of the Lungs, and come to the Liver, which is a principall member, in the little world, repreſenting the Planet <hi>Jupiter, Quaſi juvans pater,</hi> hot and moiſt, inclining towards the right ſide, under the ſhort ribs. The forme of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is <hi>Gibbous</hi> or <hi>Bunchy</hi> on the back ſide; on the other ſide hollow like the inſide of an hand: that it might be pliable to the ſtomach; (as a mans hand is to an apple or any thing that is round,) to further its digeſtion: for his heat is to the Stomach, as the heat of a fire is to the pot which hangeth over it. It is the Store-houſe of the blood, the Fountaine of the Veines, the ſeat of the naturall nouriſhing faculty, or vegetative ſoul, ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the Blood of that Chile which it draweth from the Meſeraique Veins, and receiveth by the <hi>Vena porta</hi> which entereth into the concavities thereof, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is ſent and diſtributed through the whole body by the help of <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> which ariſeth from the bunch or branches thereof, which are in great numbers as the Rivers from the Ocean.</p>
               <p>The naturall and nutrimentall faculty hath its reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Liver, and is diſperſed through the whole body, with the Veins, from which are bred four perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115825:22"/> humours, viz: Blood, Choller, Flegme, and Melancholly.</p>
               <p>It is ſo excellent and neceſſary a member, that I dare not give credit to their opinions who ſay it may be wanting in a man; as ſome ſay it was in one <hi>Mathias Ortelius</hi> a Merchant in Antwerp.</p>
               <p>Blood is made of meat perfectly concocted, in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hot and moiſt, <hi>Jupiters</hi> darling, the moſt perfect and neceſſary humour, (the other three being ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, yet neceſſary too). The blood thus concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is drawn out by the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> whoſe branches ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefying upwards and downwards, carrieth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigheth it to all other members of the body, for their nouriſhment, where, by a third digeſtion, it is tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Choller is made of meat more then perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, it is the ſpume or froth of blood: it clarifieth all the humours, heats the body, nouriſheth the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. It is in quality hot and dry; it fortifieth the attractive faculty, as blood doth the digeſtive; it moveth man to activity and valour, it is under the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net <hi>Mars,</hi> whoſe reſidence is in the Gall: which is an officiall member, a purſe or pannicular veſicle, placed in the hollowneſſe of the Liver, whoſe office is to receive the Cholerick ſuperfluities, which are engendered in the Liver as aforeſaid. Which Purſe or Bagge hath three holes or necks; by the firſt it draweth to it ſelfe the choler from the Liver, that ſo the blood be not hurt by the choller. By the ſecond it ſendeth choller to the bottome of the Stomach, to fortifie the attractive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

               <p>Flegme is made of meat not perfectly digeſted, it fortifieth the virtue expulſive (what it is, and what tho other faculties are, you have heard in the fifth Chapter) and maketh the body fit for ejection, it is kind to, and fortifieth the Braine by its conſimilitude with it, it is antipatheticall to the apprehenſion, and doth much injure it, therefore flegmatick perſons have but weak apprehenſions; It is cold and moiſt in quality, its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle is in the Lungs, it is governed by the Moon and <hi>Venus:</hi> Therefore it qualifies choller, cooles and moiſteneth the Heart, (as you heard before in the deſcription of the Lungs) thereby ſuſtaining it and the whole body, from the fiery effects, which continuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would produce.</p>
               <p>Melancholly is the ſedement of blood, it is cold and dry inquality: it maketh men ſober, ſolid and ſtaid, fit for ſtudy, or any ſerious emploiment: It curbs the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled toys and fooleries incident to the ſanguine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion: it ſtayeth wandering and idle thoughts, and reduceth them home to the Centre: It is like a grave Counſeller to the whole body. It is governed by the Planet <hi>Saturn,</hi> it ſtrengtheneth the retentive faculty, and its receptacle is in the ſpleen, which in the body is placed on the beſt ſide, tranſverſly linked to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hollerius</hi> reports that a woman at <hi>Paris,</hi> was found without a Spleen: And <hi>Pliny,</hi> in his naturall Hiſtory, ſaith that in <hi>Cawnus</hi> men are born without it: and hence the common people thought, that it might be ſafely cut out of Footmen and Horſes, and as it hath been wanting in ſome, ſo it hath abounded in others: <hi>Fallopius</hi> obſerved three that lay one upon another. One was ſeen ſo great that it weighed above 20 pounds, <hi>Colum. Anatom.</hi>

               <p>Another had a Milt weighed 23, pound. Where it increaſeth, the body decreaſeth, becauſe it ſucks away too much Chilus from the Liver. Therefore fitly did <hi>Trd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> liken the Spleen to the Treaſury; for as that grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth rich, the common people grow poore: So, as the Spleen encreaſeth, the other parts decay.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of the Reines and Kidneys.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOw I come to a few words of the Reines and Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, which are placed within the region of the Nutrites, backward; and they are ordained to cleanſe the blood from the watry ſuperfluities: They have two paſſages; by the one is drawn the water from <hi>Venakelis</hi> by two Veines, which are called <hi>Venae emulgentes,</hi> the Emulgent Veines, and by the other is ſent the ſame wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Bladder, and this is called <hi>Poros Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Kidneys are made of a hard ſubſtance, and full of hard concavities, and therefore the ſores of them are hard to cure, they are harder in ſubſtance then any other fleſhy member, and that for two cauſes; the firſt is that they be not much hurt by the ſharpneſſe of the Urine.</p>
               <p>The other is, that the Urine that paſſeth from them, might be the better cleanſed by them. The Heart ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an Artery to convey to them blood, heat, Spirit and Life. And from the Liver there commeth a Veine, which bringeth nutriment to all blood. Their fatneſs is as of the other members, made of thin blood congealed and cradded by cold; there is ordained the greater
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115825:24"/> quantity in this place, becauſe it ſhould temper the heat of the Kidneys, which they have of the biting ſharpneſſe of the Urine.</p>
               <p>The next thing that offereth it ſelfe to our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the Bladder, which is compounded of two nerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous panicles, in complexion it is cold and dry, whoſe neck is carnous and hath two Muſcles to withhold and to let go: in man it is long and is contained with the yard paſſing through <hi>peritoneum,</hi> but in women it is ſhorter, and is contained with the Vulva, the place of the Bladder is between the ſhare bone and <hi>Longaon,</hi> (commonly called the Arſe Gut). In women it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the aforeſaid bone and the Matrix. In the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is implanted the Ureters, which bring the Urine or water from the Kidneys thither; and privily entereth into the holes and pannicles thereof, which is don by a naturall motion between Tunicle, and Tunicle; till the Urine findeth the hole of the nether Tunicle, where it entereth privily into the concavity. And the more the Bladder is filled with Urine, the ſtreighter be the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles compreſſed together: The holes be not ſet one againſt the other, ſo that if the bladder be never ſo full, none can go back againe,</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Micocroſmicall</hi> Ocean, into which all the Rivers of the body diſcharge themſelves. There muſt needs be more then a watry ſubſtance in it: for many times in dileaſes, it is plentifully made, though the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient drinketh little or nothing. And it is obſerved that Creatures that drink nothing will make water. Phyſitians oftentimes foretell many things by their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, thinneſſe, and thickneſſe. Salt you know is hid in meats, and that plants have very much Salt in them, you may find by diſtilling them: And it is very well known, that, by the Chymicall art, many kinds of Salt may be fetched out of Urines. The artificiall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115825:24"/> 
                  <hi>Chryſocolla</hi> is made of Urine. <hi>Nitre</hi> is made of earth moiſtned with the Urine and Dung of living Creatures. The Urine hath a ſympatheticall relation to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body. The <hi>Arabians</hi> ſay, among the reſt <hi>Abenzoar,</hi> that a man that is bitt with a mad dogge, in his Urine the picture of Doggs may be ſeen: but this is attributed to the force of the Venome, which changeth a mans conſtitution, and maketh it like to a dogs. <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nert us</hi> himſelfe ſaith, that it doth ſo much corrupt the humours, that little Creatures like Puppies are bred in the body. If we credit the writings of wiſe, honeſt, and learned men (which not to do were uncharitable) we ſhall find, that wormes and many kinds of living Creatures have been bred in the Bladder: We read of a Woman that voided one, that way, a ſpan long; and a Maid, many as big as Woodlice. One voided one like a Magpye, another who had the Stone in the Bladder, voided two with Horns, ſharp head, back and belly cruſty, black, and like a Tortoiſe, only their belleys were red. Another voided a living Scorpion, and another ſhell-fiſh. The paſſage of the Urine from the Bladder, all know; yet ſometimes men are known to void their Urine another way. The Son of one <hi>Boninus</hi> urined, a little beneath the Glans. A maid at the Hague of a noble family, made water at her Navell. One, by an Ulcer on his Buttock, and another by the Belly. For my own part I have known two young men, who urined between the Teſticles and the Fundament: read <hi>Fernelius.</hi> l. 6. c. 13. who affirme the ſame thing. I need not tell you that ſtones are bred in the Urine of a faeculent matter, mingled with Salt and ſtony juice ſomtimes ſmall, and ſometimes great, of ſeverall ſhapes and forms: ſometimes, like the Sea ſand, ſomtimes like peebles, ſomtimes like Salt, and ſomtimes they are found ragged and branching, lively and excellently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115825:25"/> the ſtock and branches of Corall: few or none are ignorant of this. Thus have I, with as much brevity as may be, deſcribed this <hi>Microcoſmicall</hi> Ocean.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of the Generative parts.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Shall herein uſe as much brevity as may be; and ſhall write nothing, but with a mind that is modeſt, and with ſuch a mind, <hi>I</hi> deſire, it may be read. The inſtruments of generation are of two ſorts, Male, and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; their uſe is the procreation of mankind; the operation is by action and paſſion: the Agent is the ſeed, the patient the blood. Although this cometh to be ſpoken of in the laſt place, yet it might have deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly been put in the firſt; for nature regards not only the conſervation of its ſelfe, but to beget its like, and conceive its ſpecies. <hi>Venus</hi> hath the principall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the members of generation; In which members there are many parts conſiderable, but I ſhall only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitomize them.</p>
               <p>Firſt of the genitalls of men: The firſt thing to the conſidered is, that which Anatomiſts call, <hi>vaſa pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantia:</hi> or preparing veſſells, which bring blood and vitall Spirits to the Stones: they are fout in number, &amp; before they come to the ſtones, they make a curious implication, intertexture, or twiſting the one with the other, the Arteries into the Veins, and the Veines into the Arteries: which Phyſitians call <hi>Corpus Varicoſum;</hi> ſome call it <hi>Pampiniformis.</hi> This interweaving reacheth down even into the ſubſtance of the ſtones; their uſe is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115825:25"/> to mix the blood and vitall ſpirit together, that ſo the Stones may have a fit matter to work on.</p>
               <p>The Teſticles or Stones are of a white ſoft and ſpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ſubſtance, full of ſmall Veines and Arteries; or elſe, when humours flow to them, they could not ſwell to ſuch a bigneſſe: their form is Ovall of their bigneſs, few are ignorant. Each ſtones hath a Muſcle which the learned call <hi>Cremaſter,</hi> which ſerveth to pull up the ſtones in the act of Generation; as its name in the Greek ſignifieth that ſo the veſſells being flockned, may better avoid the ſeed.</p>
               <p>The ſeed being throughly concocted by the Teſticles or Stones, there are two other ſmall pipes, called <hi>vaſa deferentia,</hi> they are alſo called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick pores: their office is to carry the ſeed to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary veſſells, who are to keep it till need requireth its expulſion. From the ſtones they ariſe, very neare to the preparing veſſells, into the cavity of the belly; then turning back again, they turne to the backſide of the bladder, between it and the right gut. There they are joyned to the ſeminall Veſſells, which are ſoft and ſpungy, ſomwhat like kernells, through which paſſeth the <hi>Urethra,</hi> or common paſſage in the yard both for ſeed and Urine.</p>
               <p>Hiſtories make mention, and experience evidenceth; that ſome are borne without ſtones, ſome with one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Philip, Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Haſſia,</hi> had three: he was ſo full of ſeed, and prone to Venerious actions, that his Wife could not ſuffer him ſo often as neceſſity urged him to it; he otherwiſe being chaſt and honeſt: He relating his mind to the Prieſts, with the conſent of his Wife, took a Concubine.</p>
               <p>It would be too tedious, if I ſhould take upon me to deſcribe the yard, and all the parts thereof, it would make my book ſwell too big, and I ſhould run beyond my
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115825:26"/> firſt intention, <hi>viz:</hi> only to give a breife touch of the moſt conſiderable parts.</p>
               <p>I now come to the Generative parts of women: and ſhall be ſilent in what is viſible, and declare only the internall parts for brevity ſake, and firſt of the <hi>Clytoris,</hi> which is a ſinewy and hard body, much like the yard of a man, and ſuffers erection and falling; cauſeth luſt in women, and giveth delight in copulation. <hi>Avicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> calleth it the Wand, or <hi>Albathara,</hi> and <hi>Albucaſis</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it <hi>Tentigo:</hi> and <hi>Fallopius</hi> ſaith, that this hath ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times grown ſo bigg, that women would copulate with others like men. This obſerve, that the paſſage of the Urine is not through the neck of the Wombe: Near the paſſage of the Urine are four Caruncles or fleſhy knobs, they are called <hi>Myrtiformes,</hi> becauſe they reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Myrtleberryes. The uppermoſt of them is largeſt and forked, to receive the neck of the paſſage of the Urine: the other lye below this on the ſides, and are to keep back the aire or any hurtfull thing from the Womb. In Virgins, theſe knobs are joyned together by a thin skin, interlated with many ſmall Veins, with a hole in the middle, about the bigneſſe of ones little finger, through which paſſeth the menſtruous blood: This skin is a note of Virginity: for the firſt act of copulation breaketh it. I believe that this was that note of Virginity which God gave to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> Theſe knobs joyned together do much reſemble a Roſe not quite blown, therefore called a flower, thence came the word to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower a Virgin. If I ſhould take upon me to declare the opinions of Authors, it would prove (almoſt) an endleſſe taske: This I ſhall add, that I conceive it not a certaine note of Virginity, becauſe it may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without the act of copulation, as namely by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of peſſaries, to provoke the Menſtrues, or by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion of ſharpe humours, &amp;c: but 'tis probable that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115825:26"/> the Jewiſh Virgins were more chary of it, their reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on depending thereon.</p>
               <p>The Wombe in figure is almoſt perfectly round, in Virgins about the bign eſſe of a walnut, yet when a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is conceived with Child, it dilates it ſelfe to ſuch a capacity that it is able to containe the Child; the mouth of it no bigger then to receive the Glans of the Gard: yet at the delivery makes roome for the Child to come out be it never ſo big. This made <hi>Galen</hi> admire, and it may be a great admiration to all: If we conſider the wonderfull works of God in the Creation of man. He who knows himſelfe may know there is an All power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God. And therefore it was engraven with letters of Gold, over the Porch of the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> the God (according to the Panims) of knowledge and wiſdome, this ſentence, <hi>Know thy ſelfe,</hi> as a ſalutation unto all, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying, that he that would have acceſſe unto that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and enterance into that Temple, muſt firſt know Himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But I returne to my intended diſcourſe: The Womb before conception is ſmall, becauſe the Seed, being but little in quantity, might be cloſe embraced and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. It hath but one cavity, though it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, approved opinion, that it hath ſeaven Cells, and of this opinion was <hi>Galen,</hi> the truth is the matrix in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men differ much from beaſts, and <hi>Galen</hi> never ſaw a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Anatomized.</p>
               <p>Women have Teſticles or Stones as men have, but they differ from mens in theſe particulars. They are within the Belly in women, in men without. They are not ſo ſmooth in women, as in men. They are leſſe then the Stones of men. They are not ſtaid by muſcies, but by Ligaments. As men's are Ovall, theirs are flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh. They have but one skin, mens have four, becauſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115825:27"/> they are without the body, and expoſed to the cold. They are more ſoft, and colder then mens are.</p>
               <p>But they are ordained both in men and women for the ſame uſe, <hi>viz:</hi> to concoct ſeed: and though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed ſeed in women, yet Hippocrates, one of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of Phyſick was of this judgment: reaſon and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience confirmeth it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>vaſa praeparantia,</hi> the preparing Veſſells, &amp; <hi>vaſa deferentia,</hi> carrying Veſſells, are of the ſame nature, and office as they are in men: They differ only in this, that they are ſomwhat ſhorter, having a ſhorter way to go, the Teſticles being with in the Belly in women: but leſt the ſhortneſſe of the paſſage ſhould hinder their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, God and nature hath ſo provided, that they are more twiſted and interweaved than they are in men, that they may the better mingle the blood and vitall Spirit, as you have heard before.</p>

               <p>GOd in his Power, having created all things; in his Wiſdom, by Nature, governeth and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them all: by her, are the variable moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and revolutions of the Sun, Moon, and Stars har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monically preſerved: in her hands, are the mutations and Cataſtrophes of times: ſhe is the moderator of the ſourging Ocean: This immenſity of things ſhe gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in a certain, and immutable order. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the univerſe, but yeilds obedience to this Law: whatever are contained in the Animal, Vegetable, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Kingdoms, are wiſely governed, and providenial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerved, by the Will of the Divine Architector, in the Government of Nature.</p>
               <p>But to ſteer our courſe nearer to our intention; the little world, or body of man, is ſubject to natures government whoſe Deputy or Repreſentative is Phyſick; <hi>Naturae le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus eſſe medicinae leges conſentaveas:</hi> The Laws of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick are agreeable to the Laws of Nature: Phyſick imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates Nature, its deſign is to preſerve the body in health, defend it from infirmities, to ſtrengthen, and corroborate the weak, to raiſe the dejected, in a word, to keep the body in health and comfort, till the approach of death, to whoſe yoak all muſt yield: whoſe Laws, the greateſt Monarchs, Kings, and Princes, cannot reſiſt. To this one Law all people of every Countrey, Nation, quality and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115825:29"/> degree become obedient; as to a Law, moſt neceſſary, moſt excellent, ſound pure &amp; juſt; being grounded upon, and drawn from the pureſt and moſt wholſom fountains of Nature. It is not ſtrict nor rigid, but mild and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; it ſuccoureth, refreſheth, and reſtoreth thoſe that have languiſhed by reaſon of tedious diſeaſes: health of body is all the comfort a man hath in this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and turbulent world: this is that, which maketh humane actions to flouriſh: ſhe is the moſt excellent chamber companion, ſhe is the richeſt treaſure; for ſhe is more precious then gold, the beſt of all earthly goods; to ſay all, Without it, no earthly thing is a bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Hence it cometh, that the Art of Phyſick hath gained a reverend eſteem in all Ages: and the Phyſicians ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, more than humane honour. <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Art from <hi>Aegypt</hi> into <hi>Greece:</hi> the <hi>Greciaus</hi> (thinking he could raiſe the dead) honoured, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him as a god, &amp; his two daughters as goddeſſes. Indeed the difficulty of Medicine brings the more honour &amp; dignity to a good Phyſician, which generally is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: A good Phyſician ought to be a man learned, honeſt, gentle, diligent. He ought to truſt in God, more than in his own skill. He ought to know what he would do, and be able to put it into practice, becauſe the health and life of mankind is committed into his hands. And, as he imitates Chriſt who cures the ſoul, the Phyſician the body; ſo he ought to imitate him in a holy and unblameable converſation. He ought to deny himſelf, and to be very tender of the poor. He muſt not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in Divinity, well skilled in Anatomy, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Simples, and making up of compound Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines: And (ſaith <hi>Galen</hi>) if he be ignorant of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the maticks, he is a murderer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Aphoriſms deſcribes a Phyſician thus; He ought in diſcourſe to be witty and ſolid: and ſo let him behave himſelf in reproving the errors of his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and thoſe that look to him, Let him not be fearful nor over conſident, but let him walk in the middle path, between fear and confidence. He ſhould be neat in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and mind, temperate in diet, a hater of venereous and laſcivious actions: let every wiſe man beware of a drunken Phyſician, or any way viciouſly inclined. Let him not greedily deſire honour, but what he honeſtly getteth by his Art; let him not beg it of others, nor confer it upon himſelf. Let him be courteous and have a fellow feeling of others miſeries. Let him declare the event of a diſeaſe, ſo far as he knoweth it, that ſo he may ſtir up the ſick to obedience, and avoid the ignominſe of that may be caſt upon the Art: yet let him ſo declare it, as not to afflict the mind with the Diſeaſe of the body. A good Phyſician is not envious at the ſucceſſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor will he detract from his due praiſe. He ought not to be dogged, curriſh, ſcurrilous, nor ridiculous, to be familiar with all, and ſpeak no more than becometh him: let him uſe but few words, and thoſe that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the purpoſe. Let gravity and love, be read in his face. He ought to viſit the ſick as often as neceſſity requireth, and ſpeak comfortably to him. Let no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly action, nor uncivil word proceed from him. Let him not forſake his Patient for any cauſe whatſoever. Let him conſult with God in the beginning of all his cures, and heartily give God thanks for the performance of them. Let him love godlineſs, and honeſty, and be an unblameable ſervant to God, and Nature. Theſe are the principal and chief Characters, by which every diſeaſed man may make choice of his Phyſician, of whom <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſay with the learned <hi>Fernelius: Medicus remedia confert, non ſolum ut naturae miniſter, fed interdum

                  <p>This Diſeaſe is cauſed through blood or other humors abounding, or by ſharp humors, or vapours within or without the Scull, inflaming the Head: ſometimes weakneſſe of the Head is the Cauſe.</p>

                  <p>If fulneſſe of humors be the cauſe of the Diſeaſe: then is the Head very heavy and lumpiſh: if the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors be ſharp, the pain is felt with pricking &amp; ſhooting, if there be inflammation, the Head worketh like the Pulſes: if wind be the peccant cauſe, there is found di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtention or ſtretching out, without heavineſs or beating: if two or more of theſe Symptomes appear together, judge accordingly.

                     </gap> of the whole body: and if age, ſtrength and the ſeaſon conſent, open the Gephalick or head Vein: If flegmatick and viſcuous humors, be the Cauſe, it is good to extenuate and make thin the humors, thus; Take of <hi>Oximel ſcilliticum,</hi> and ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of <hi>Staechas,</hi> of each half an ounce; diſtilled water of Marjerom, Betony and Parſley, an ounce; mix theſe and make a potion for the morning. Or elſe make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction in this manner; Take Mint, Calamint, Marje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, Betony, Sage, of each half a handful: the ſeeds of ſweet Fennel, Annis, and Parſtey of each half an ounce; the roots of Aſparagus, Fennel, and Parſley, of each two ounces; Peony root, half an ounce; ſhread the hearbs, bruiſe the ſeeds, ſlice the roots, and take out the pith, and boil it in a quart of water till half be conſumed, ſtrein it, and add of ſyrup of Betony compound, one ounce: and <hi>Oximel ſimplex</hi> as much; and make a potion for three times; take it, at night two hours after a light ſupper; the Body thus prepared, you may come to purge, and evacuate the peccant humours: Take half a dram of <hi>Pill. Cochiae,</hi> the greater in the morning, and keep the Chamber; they which are moſt commendable are pills of Hiera with Agarick; Take half a drachm at night two hours after a light ſupper, take ſome warm broth in the morning, and keep the houſe; thus do for a week or longer: in like manner you may uſe <hi>Pill. Alephanginae,</hi> and order your body as before: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that groſſe and clammy-humours will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115825:31"/> a ſudden purgation, and therefore often purging is uſed, that ſo they may be drawn out by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Alſo cliſters are neceſſary becauſe they cleanſe the bowels, and pull back thoſe humours and vapours, which aſcend and annoy the head: Take of Mallows, Pellitorie of the Wall, Endive, Succorie, Violet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves, Cammomell-flowers, of each one handfull, ſweet Fennellſeed, halfe an ounce, Linſeed, Two drach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, boile them in a quart of Spring water, (or rather cleare poſſet-drink,) till halfe be conſumed, ſtreine it out; and to the decoction, adde of the pulpe of Caſsia Fiſtula, one ounce; Oile of Rue halfe an ounce, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictae Laxativae, half an ounce.</p>
                  <p>The Body being purged by diſcretion, it is not amiſſe, for the patient to make uſe of ſome diet drink, that hath power to warme the braine, to exſiccate and concoct crude humours, to attenuate the groſſe, cut that which is tough, and expell the thinneſt, either by Urine, or inſenfible tranſpiration.</p>
                  <p>You may make it thus. Take of Guajacum, Saſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fras, the Root of Salſaperilla, of each two ounces, Engliſh Liquoris, and Cinamon, of each one ounce, Coriander-ſeed halfe an ounce: infuſe them 24 houres in 4 quarts of Spring-water, the veſſell ſtanding in hot embers, and cloſe covered; afterwards boile it gently to the conſumption of halfe, ſweeten it with honey, whilſt it is hot; let the Patient drink halfe a pint in the morning, and diſpoſe himſelf for ſweat: and if he drink it for his ordinary drink, 15 or 20 dayes more or leſſe, as neceſsity requireth, it is the better. If the Patient become coſtive by the uſe of this diet drink, let him take a Clyſter, as often as need requireth: and once in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes let him take ſome purging medicine; that day, omitting the diet drink.</p>

                  <p>This bole, taken in the morning two houres before meat, is exceeding good to ſtrengthen the head, after due evacuation of the peccant humours, viz: Conſerve of Roſes, and of Roſemary-flowers, of each two ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, of Venice Treacle the weight of both, with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fine Sugar, make bole, and adminiſter it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe may Gargariſms be made, and uſed in manner following: Take the root of Maſterwort a drachme, Long-Pepper and Nutmegs, halfe a dram: Muſtard-ſeed one ſcruple, beat them to powder, and put them in a linnen cloth, and chew it halfe an hour, which will purge the head of groſſe and phlegmatique humours.</p>
                  <p>Somtimes it is convenient to uſe Sneezing-Powders, and you may make them in this ſort: Take the Leaves of Marjarom, Roſemary, and Betony dryed, two ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, white Hellebore, Cloves, Nutmegs, Cubeba, of each halfe a ſcruple, beat them into fine powder, and, by the help of a quill, provoke ſneezing.</p>
                  <p>Alſo a quilt, to corroborate and ſtrengthen the Brain may be thus made: Take of Wood-Betony dryed, one ounce: the flowers of Roſemary, and Stachas, a Drachm; Red-roſe-leaves, two drachms, Frankinſence, Maſtick, Benzoin, Mace and Cloves, of each halfe a Drachme, beat them to powder and quilt it in Silk or Linnen, and apply it warme.</p>
                  <p>I might here reach you to make Plaiſters to corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the braine, to attract, or reſolve the humours, but I forbeare here for brevityes-ſake, and referr you to its proper place, where I ſhall treat of the making of Plaiſters and their uſes.</p>
                  <p>If the diſtemper hath its originall from Cholerick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; let him uſe meats and drinks that are naturally cold and moiſt; it is convenient that the humours be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115825:32"/> prepared, quenched, and concocted: for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you may uſe this medicine following; Sirrup of Violets one ounce, of Water-Lillies, halfe an ounce, diſtilled waters of Endive, Succory and Lettuce, of each one ounce, mix them, and drink it in the morning faſting; the humours thus concocted, and made mild and obedient unto nature, may the better be removed by purging medicines: To which purpoſe, take fine Rubarb two drachms, Spickuard, one ſcruple, cut ſmall and infuſed in the diſtilled water of Endive, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory, and bugloſſe of each one ounce, for the ſpace of twelve houres: diſſolve therein a drachme of the electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of the juyce of Roſes, and make a purging potion. Pills of Reubarbs, and Alephangina may be ſafely uſed in this caſe: the doſe is a ſcruple or halfe a drachme ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at night going to bed: Pill, aureae, or golden Pills taken halfe a drachm in the morning, purgeth chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick and other offenſive humours from the head.</p>
                  <p>Clyſters in this caſe profiteth much. Take of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction for a Clyſter before deſcribed: adde one ounce of Caſſia fiſtula, Hiera picra halfe an ounce, oyle of Roſes one ounce, Salt halfe a drachme, mix them and make a Clyſter.</p>
                  <p>After purging of the Cholerick humour it is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to coole and ſtrengthen the head by outward medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines: oyle of Roſes, and oyle of Cammomell, mixed with a little white-Wine-Vinegar, is good to anoint the head; but if there need greater cooling, you may adde to the oyles juyce of Houſleek, Purſlane, Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhade or Sorrell. If the ſick cannot ſleep, anoint the forehead with oyle of Water Lillies and Poppy.</p>
                  <p>If the ſymptomes declare wind to be the cauſe, let the Patient eſchue all meats that do breed windineſſe, empty the belly with Clyſters; that are made of ſuch things as do naturally diſſolve windineſſe: viz. The
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115825:33"/> ſeeds of Anniſe, Sweet Fennell, Carraway and Comin, of each one ounce, boile them in a quart of poſſet-drink till halfe be waſted, ſtreine it, and adde to the liquor Catholicon, and diaphaenicon, of each halfe an ounce. This Cliſter doth not only purge the inteſtines, and thoſe parts about the Liver, but alſo pulleth back thoſe vapours which aſcend to the Head.</p>
                  <p>To the outſide of the Head may be applyed repulſive medicines, as Vinegar, Wormwood, Melilot, Mints, Pomegranate-rinds, Shephards Pouch, Purſlane, Lawrell, Nutmeggs, &amp;c: After a moderate uſe of theſe, adde medicines that have power to mitigate, concoct, and digeſt: as Camomell, Linſeed, Fenugreek, Saffron, yelks of Eggs, Hens and Gooſe-greaſe. Laſtly, apply medicines that have power to diſcuſſe, viz: meale of Lupines, and Barley, Lilly-roots, Nigella, oyles of Dill and Rew.</p>

                  <p>For the cure of this diſtemper, the blood, or cholet afflicting the braine, muſt be diſcuſſed, pulled back, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, and evacuated, ſo, that the diſtemper of the head be removed, the ſtrength of the head, and of the whole body be preſerved. It is convenient, as ſoon as the diſeaſe is diſcovered to open a Veine, having firſt adminiſtred a Clyſter, thus made: Take of the Leaves of Violets, Mallows, Endive, Beets, and Lettuce, of each one handfull, of the root of Marſh-Mallows an ounce, of the flowers of water-Lillies, and the tops of Dill, of each halfe a handfull, let them be boiled in a ſufficient quantity of Barley-water; then ſtreined out to a pint of this decoction, diſſolve Caſſia newly drawne, Sirrup of Violets, Diaprunum Lenitive, of each halfe an ounce, browne Sugar one ounce, and make a Clyſter.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:115825:34"/>
                  <p>You muſt, ſoone after the Patient hath had a ſtoole, open the Cephalick or Head-Veine, but if blood do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, open the Baſilick or Liver-veine, or the middle Veine firſt, and after a while breathe the cephalick Vein. If you find that ſuppreſſion of Menſtrues, or the hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoid, hath been the cauſe of the diſtemper, you may firſt open the Veine under the Ancle called Saphaena, and afterwards open the Cephalick Veine. If the age, and ſtrength of the Patient forbid not, you muſt bleed him often in the Cephalick Vein; if the body be weak open the Veine under the Ancle: be ſure not to draw too much blood at once, leaſt the ſick faint. If you feare blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting, by reaſon of age, want of ſtreangth, or a bad ſeaſon, uſe cupping with ſcarification, behind the neck upon the back bone.</p>
                  <p>It is good alſo to uſe Frictions, and Ligatures upon the legs, and to draw bliſters upon the Armes and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                  <p>After Phlebotomy, you muſt apply medicines that do coole the Braine, and repell, and hinder the humours from aſcending to the head: as Oyle of Roſes two ounces, Roſe Vinegar one ounce, the water of Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, and Lettuce, of each two ounces, with the whites of two Eggs, mingle them together, and apply it, to the forehead with a double cloath. If that prove not eſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious, take oyle of Mandrakes, Roſes, Violets, and water Lillyes of each two drachms; the juice of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce and Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But here let me adviſe people; to be very wary and carefull in the applying of theſe medicines; by no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>anes apply cooling medicines in the extremity of the fit; nor refrigerate and ſtupſie the Braine too ſodainly; leſt by overmuch cooling you turn the Frenſie into a Lethargy, and make your Patient ſleep his laſt. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115825:34"/> conſider from the Symptomes of the diſeaſe, to what part of the head, to apply your medicine, having conſideration to the age of your patient, and ſeaſon of the yeare, your Wit will informe you, whether you are beſt to apply it warm or cold. If you find the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion extend it ſelfe to the skin, and exterior parts, uſe no repelling medicines, for feare you drive the diſtemper to the Braine.</p>
                  <p>It is convenient likewiſe to refrigerate the interior parts, thus; take of the ſyrups of Violet, erratick Poppys, and Pomegranates, of each four drachms: the diſtilled waters of Plant, Lettuce, Poppy, and Purſlane of each two ounces, mix them and make a julep, for three doſes. This electuary is good in this caſe: Conſerve of Roſes and Violets, of each one ounce; the conſerve of Clove-Gilliflowers, and water Lillys, of each halfe an ounce; Diamargatiton frigidum, halfe a drachme, with Syrup of Violets: make it into an electuary, give the ſick the quantity of a Nutmeg, once in an houre, two, or three as neceſſity ſhall require.</p>
                  <p>Having thus prepared the humours, you may evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them by purgations, but it is convenient to uſe the moſt gentle purgers; you may ſafely adminiſter an ounce of Catholicon in the evening; drink ſomwhat warme in the morning, it is a fine cooling and gentle purge. Or you may make a decoction of ſome cooling hearbs, and in halfe a pint of the liquor warme, infuſe therein a drachme of Rubarb 12. hours; diſſolve there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in halfe an ounce of Catholicon, and two drachms of ſyrup of Roſes, and make a potion. Let his drink be Barly water, and mingle with it, the ſyrup of Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats, Lemons or Barberies. By this you may know how to cure not onely Frenſies, but all ravings and wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings which are ingendred by Feavers.</p>

               <p>THe Latines call this diſeaſe <hi>Inſania,</hi> and <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> and the Greeks <hi>Mania,</hi> we call it Madneſſe, In this diſtemper the body is much out of order, and the Spirits much diſquieted: It cometh without a Feavour, and therein it differeth from the Frenſie. This diſeaſe is cauſed, ſomtimes of the abundance of blood flowing up to the Braine: Somtimes of hot and cholerick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or of a hot diſtemper of the Braine. The Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of Madneſſe, are, weakneſſe of the Head, tickling of the Eares, and ſhinings before their eyes, watchings, ſtrange thoughts, and ravenous appetite: If it proceed from the abundance of blood, there followeth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all laughing, objects of laughter evermore appearing before the eyes. When it proceedeth from both blood and choler, it cauſeth a daſhing and fervent motion in the braine, which maketh the ſick irefull, full of motion, and bold. But if the choler wax groſſe, the ſick is more mad, and harder to cure.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort of Madneſs, cauſed by melancholy occupying the mind and changing the temperature of it: Somtimes the blood is generally corrupted by melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the brain hurt thereby. Somtimes melancholly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood aſcendeth to the braine, when the blood is not generally corrupted. Somtimes inflammations, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and evill effects of the Stomach and Spleen may be the cauſe thereof. There are many Signes of this diſtemper, they which are moſt common are theſe; fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe, ſadneſſe, hatred, and very ſtrange imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Some have fancyed themſelves beaſts, and have counterfeited the voice of Beaſts: others, earthen-pots,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115825:35"/> and have fled from company for feare of being broken: Somtimes they deſire death, and to make away them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Somtimes they much dread death. Some think themſelves inſpired with the holy Spirit, and do Propheſie; others fancy themſelves great Philoſophers. If the blood be generally corrupted, the body is leane, pale, and rough, and generally melancholly. They, whoſe diſtemper ariſe from defects of the ſtomach or Spleen: have burnings, grevious inflammations, and plucking of the ſides, are ſubject to be coſtive; troubled with wind fuming to the head, cauſing lightneſſe and troubleſome dreames.</p>
               <p>For the cure: If blood abound (after the adminiſtring of a Clyſter) you muſt come to blood-letting: You may open the Cephalick; if that appeare not, the middle veine: draw as much blood as the ſtrength of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent will beare: you may, as you find occaſion, open the veine in the forehead, if it appeare: if the ſick be a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man open the veine under the Ancle, you may alſo bleed the Hemorrhoid-veines. I beſeech you, not only here, but in all other diſtempers, to be very carefull, and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of your Patients blood; draw not too much at a time leſt you weaken nature too much: in this caſe it is beſt often to bleed, and in the mean time, keep the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſoluble, either by Clyſters, made as the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will direct you, or other convenient purges, <hi>viz:</hi> Take black Hellebore ſliced ſmall, one ounce; infuſe it three days in a quarter of a pint of raine-water: then boile it gently to the conſumption of the third part, (keeping it cloſe covered) ſtreine it out and add to the liquor, two ounces of clarified honey: let the ſick drink halfe an ounce (in the morning) in a little broath or poſſet-drink, for ſeverall dayes together: increaſe or decreaſe the doſe according to the ſtrength or debility of your patient. Or take of the extract of black Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115825:36"/> halfe a ſcruple, Syrrup of Violets, one ounce; mix it for one doſe.</p>
               <p>If the body require a ſtronger purgation; Take of <hi>Diagridium,</hi> and <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> of each halfe a drachme. <hi>Turbith,</hi> one drachm: <hi>Sena,</hi> halfe an ounce, Epithymum, <hi>Cremo-tartar</hi> of each two drachms: Of Cinamon, and Citron pills, of each one ſcruple; Safron, halfe a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Let them be finely pulverized, the doſe is a drachme or four Scruples adminiſtred in broath or ſome other convenient Liquor. Theſe are convenient medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which purge both choler and melancholly. You may purge with confectio Hamech, Diaſenae, Pillulae Indae, Pill: Lapid: Lazuli; the doſe muſt be regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to your patients condition, ſtrength, and age. Before you come to purging, make uſe of altering or preparing medicines; Take of the ſlowers of Borage, Bugloſſe, and Violets; of Harts-tongue, Fumitory, and Tamarisk, of each one handfull; Raiſons of the Sun ſtoned, one ounce: barke of the root of Capers, three drachms: roots of Fennell, Parſly, Lycoriſh, of each a drachme, boile them all gently in three pints of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till one be conſumed, ſtreine them out, and clarifie the liquor with whites of eggs; add to the ſame, of the ſyrups of Fumitory, Epithimum, and Apples magiſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, of each one o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce: Take halfe a pint in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; uſe this, or medicines of this nature, three or four dayes: twice in the week, purge gently; twice in a month adminiſter a ſtrong purge: ever remember in the meane time to uſe Phlebotomy, as neceſſity requireth: forget not to empty the body by Clyſters, if there be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: The night after you have let your patient blood, be ſure you adminiſter ſuch things, as have power to procure ſleep, which you may do thus: Take of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Roſes, Violets, and Bugloſſe flowers, of each halfe an ounce: the conſerve of the young tops of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariske,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115825:36"/> and Clove Gilliflowors; of the ſtalke of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce, and Citron rindes preſerved, of each four dra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, Mirabolanes and Emblicks, of each one: <hi>Confectio Alchermes</hi> and <hi>de Hyacintho,</hi> of each two drachms, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Pearles prepared, of each two ſcruples. <hi>pil: diá Margariton frigidum,</hi> and <hi>Laetificans,</hi> halfe a drachme, mix them well in a marble or glaſſe Morter, adding one ounce of ſyrup of ſweet-ſented apples: The doſe is the quantity of a Wall-nut, drink after it a little of ſome convenient Julep or decoction. You muſt likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply repelling and diſcuſſing medicines to the head; the Chapter of the Frenſie will furniſh you with ſuch medicines. But if the Cholerick, and melancholly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in the Braine, are groſſe and hard to be removed, prepare a fomentation in this manner. Talte a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of Cephalick herrbs, viz: Betony, Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royall, Roſemary, Lettice, Plantane. Willow-leaves, Houſleek, Strawberry-leaves; Violet-leaves, Fumitory, Water-Lillys (or their Flowers) Staechas, Poppys, boile them in a ſufficient quantity of Fountaine water: then take of Bay-berries, and the root of black Hellebore, a ſufficient quantity, croſly bruiſe them, and ſow them (with ſome of the ſofteſt of the hearbs) into a long bagg, boil the bagg a little in the aforeſaid decoction; bathe the head (being ſhaved) with the decoction, an houre, as hot as may well be indured, with double cloathes: then bind the bagg to the crowne of the head with hot clothes, let the patient lye in his bed and ſleep if he can, this will wonderfully expell the humours, through the Emunctories of the head, for it wonderfully diſcuſſeth the fuliginous matter, gathered in the head, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedies can ſcarcely performe. This you may do for nine dayes together if you ſee occaſion; but be ſure to keep the head warme afterward. If you find that obſtruction or inflammation of the Spleen, or defects
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115825:37"/> of the Stomach be the cauſe of the diſtemper, you muſt adminiſter inward and outward medicines, to open the obſtruction, and allay the inflammation; for ſuch medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, I referr you to thoſe Chapters, where I ſhall treat of the diſtempers of thoſe parts.</p>

                  <p>The Symptomes or forerunners of this diſeaſe are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and ſharp paines of the head, the Vertigo, the ſwelling of the Veins of the neck, a ſlowneſſe to move, the extreame parts of the body, cold. When the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe cometh to its height, the breathing is ſo diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it cannot be perceived, and that is a very evill

                  <head>The Cure.</head>
                  <p>They who are afflicted with either of theſe Diſeaſes, are in much danger, and have need of the ſpeedy help
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115825:38"/> of an able Phyſician, who muſt without delay uſe his beſt endeavours. Firſt let him endeavour to awake his Patient out of this dead ſleep, by preſenting forcible objects to every ſenſe: Let him place him ſo, that the Sun beams, or ſome clear light, may ſhine upon his face: Let him fill his ears with noiſe, clamours, and ſounds, and call him by his name with a loud voice, put up into his noſe things that are ſharp, as Rue, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoreum, and Vinegar: do the like to his mouth. Likewiſe you muſt provoke the ſenſe of feeling by frictions, pulling of the hair, pulling out and ſolding the fingers, and all other parts, binding, &amp;c. You muſt provoke the body to ſtool by ſharp Clyſters, thus; Take of Sage, Betony, Rue, Centory, of each one handfull: Camomel, Calamint, and Penny-royall, of each half a handful: the ſeeds of Cummin, ſweet Fennel, and Dill, of each three drachms: the roots of Polypody, ſix drachms: Agarick, three drachms: pulp of Coliquintida, one drachin; boyl them in a convenient quantity of water, untill half be conſumed; to a pint of the decoction, adde the oyls of Lillies and Rue, of each half an ounce; Hiera Picra, Benedicta Laxativa, and Diaphaenicon, of each half an ounce; Honey of Roſes, an ounce: Salt, a drachm: mix them and make a Clyſter. If your Patient be young, ſtrong, and full of hot humors, and blood, you muſt ſoon after the operation of the Clyſter, open a vein in one Arm, let him not bleed too much at once, leſt his ſtrength fail; in a few hours ſpace open a vein in the other Arm: for by that means the diſeaſe will be the more abated, and the ſtrength the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. After the firſt vein opened, if you perceive his countenance more lively, his pulſe beat more orderly and his breath fetcht with more eaſe, it is a good ſign, and a good encouragement to open another vein:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115825:38"/> Make the Orifice wide, or elſe the groſſeft blood will lye behind. Where you ſee the body abound with blood, draw blood liberally: if not, draw blood ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly.</p>
                  <p>After letting blood, if you ſee hopes of your Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents recovery, within a few hours, you muſt adminiſter ſome purgation, the time of the day matters not: one ounce of Elect. Diacarthamum, half a ſcruple of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, diſſolved in Betony water: you may in this caſe make uſe of Pillulae Cochiae, the greater, or the leſſe: or Pillulae de Agarico, (pills of Agarick.) But in the <hi>Lethargy</hi> (by reaſon it is accompanied with a Feaver) you ought to adminiſter more gentle purgations, as <hi>Pillulae Hiera cum Agarico,</hi> (I ſhall lay down ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Rules for purging, in the next Book,) which ſerve to divert the humours, flowing to the Head. But the humours there fixed, muſt be purged with Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, one Scruple: Caſtor, two ſcruples: admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in Oximel, which hath been proved with good ſucceſſe.</p>
                  <p>If hitherto your Medicines prove unſucceſsful, you muſt venter to adminiſter ſtronger, not fearing the danger or ſtrength of your Medicine, ſeeing without it, nothing can be expected. You may uſe ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines as are extracted out of Antimony, or thoſe leſſe violent, as is the infuſion of <hi>Crocus Mettallorum:</hi> or two drachms of the Tincture of Tobacco, extracted with the Spirit of Wine, doth powerfully evacuate upwards and downwards, both cholerick and flegmatick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and cleanſeth not only the Stomach and Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, but the Brain alſo.</p>
                  <p>Alſo Frictions and Ligatures on the extream parts are neceſſary, that the vapours do not aſcend to the Head. You may faſten Cupping glaſſes to the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Arms, and Thighs, with ſcarification, if you have
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115825:39"/> not let your Patient blood, otherwiſe without: forget not the often adminiſtration of Cliſters, or inſtead thereof, you may uſe Suppoſitories, made thus. Take two ounces of Honey boiled to a due thickneſſe, of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Piera, two drachms; Coloquintida, Agarick, and Scammony, of each two ſeruples: Salt gemme, one drachm: make them into fine powder, and mix them with the Honey, and make Suppoſitories as long as you think good.</p>
                  <p>You may apply things to their Noſes, which have a property to awaken them, as Vinegar, Caſtoreum, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banum, Sulphur, Goats-horn, or Harts-horn burnt, and holden to the Noſe: A fume made with white Amber, is of excellent vertue in the <hi>Apoplexy;</hi> You muſt pull them by the hair, and prick their Legs, or rub them with Salt and Vinegar: You muſt annoint the Palare of the Mouth with ſtrong and ſharp Medicines, as Mithridate, Muſtard, powder of Maſterwort: and rub the bottoms of the Feet with Salt and Vinegar, and the Palms of the Hands with the Oyls of Rue, and Caſtor. If the diſeaſe be of long continuance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke ſneezing, with thoſe Powders preſcribed in the ſecond Chapter: to which you may adde Rue and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor.</p>
                  <p>You may apply reſolving Medicines, but firſt you muſt make them thus: Take the leaves of Betony, Sage, and Roſemary, of each one handful; the tops of Lavender, and Marjerom, Rue, and Savoury, of each half a handful; the roots of Angelica, Maſterwort, and Setwall, of each one ounce; Bayberries, and Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per berries, of each half an ounce; boyl them in a ſufficient quantity of Vinegar, and with a Spunge or cloth dipped in the decoction, bathe the Head of the ſick.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:115825:39"/>
                  <p>If the Diſeaſe yield not to theſe Medicines, you may faſten Cupping g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Many precious Medicines, againſt this diſtemper, have been left to poſterity; I ſhall (omitting many) inſert this one, <hi>viz.</hi> Take of the root of Peony, and Miſleto of the Oake, of each two ounces; Calamus, Aromati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Galanga, Cyperus, of each one ounce; of Beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Sage, Marjerom, of each one handful; the ſeeds of Peony, Annis, Fennel, and Carraway, of each three drachms; the flowers of Lavender, Stechas, and Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, of each half a handful; of Nutmegs, Mace, Cubebs, Cloves, Grains of Paradice, of each half an ounce: Cinamon, two ounces: Saffron, half a drachm: of Species Diambrae, and Diamoſhi, of each two drams. Let all theſe ingredients be ſhredd and bruiſed, and put into a glaſſe Limbeck; powre on them of the beſt rectified Spirit of Wine, enough to cover them, the breadth of three fingers; digeſt them in a Bathe eight daies, afterward diſtill it, and upon occaſion admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter a drachm, or half a drachm, in ſome other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient liquor. In like manner may the Spirit of Caſtor be adminiſtred in Oximel, and 'tis a good Medicine againſt theſe Diſeaſes. Moreover, be very careful that you wel underſtand the nature of the humor offending, as if blood offend, uſe not too many refrigerating Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and bleed the more; I need ſay no more, <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum ſapientibus, &amp;c.</hi> If after ſo many Evacuations, the Brain become too cold, and much weakened, you may ſtrengthen it with Lozenges made thus, or after this manner; Take of the diſtilled oyls of Annis, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon, and Nutmegs, of each three drops: oyl of Cloves, one drop: Amber-greaſe, half a ſcruple: with four ounces of Sugar, diſſolved in Betony water,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115825:40"/> make Lozenges, take a drachm in a morning. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you may make Pills to ſtrengthen the Head in this manner: Take of the Species <hi>Cordiales temperatae,</hi> and <hi>Aromaticum Roſatum,</hi> of each two drachms; Maſtick, Nutmegs, and Cloves, of each one ſcruple; Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe, half a ſcruple: and Musk three grains; make it into a Maſſe for Pills with the juyce of Marjerom, and take a ſcruple to bedward, once or twice a week: or you may take half a drachm of the powder, called <hi>Diarrhadon Abatis,</hi> night or morning. If any fear the return of this Diſeaſe again after cure: or any (by the aforegoing Symptoms) fear its growth upon them; let them carefully conſider the humour offending: if blood abound, leſſen it by opening a vein; if Choler, flegm, or melancholy, by purgation; How you may know which humour offendeth, or by what it may be purged, this Treatiſe (if you have any ingenuity) will inform you.</p>

                     <p>It is good for thoſe that are thus afflicted, to eſchue all meats of a hard digeſture, and ſuch as afford a crude nouriſhment, or breed fumoſities; obſerve the ſame in all Diſeaſes of the Head. In the beginning of the cure, make the body ſoluble by Clyſters if need be. If plentitude appear, and the ſick be of a ſanguine complexion, begin the cure with blood letting: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe obſerve the ſame order, before preſcribed in the <hi>Cephalaea,</hi> or Headach, proceeding of groſſe and phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick humours; this remembring, to adde to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines there deſcribed, the roots and ſeeds of Peony, and Miſleto of the Oake, which have a notable faculty in the cure of the Falling-ſickneſſe, as experience teacheth. Make uſe of the ſudorifick drink, there deſcribed, thirty or fourty days, adding to every doſe, three or four drops of Vitriol; You muſt purge the ſick with <hi>Pillulae Cochiae, Pillulae cum Agarico,</hi> or ſuch as purge flegm, but remember to regulate your purges, according to the ſtrength of the ſick; and to prepare the body with Medicines, which do attenuate and cut groſſe and thick humours: as be the ſyrups of Wormwood, Hyſop, Stechas, or Oximel ſcilliticum: or with the decoction of Hyſop, the roots of Peony, or ſuch like. Stibium is of great force, and doth mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purge the ſuperfluous humours of the Head; you muſt uſe it thus, take 12 grains, and make it into fine powder; put it into four ounces of Wine, and there let it remain 24, hours, ſhaking it every three or four hours; then powre off the Wine, leaving the powder, and drink it with a little Sugar: let none uſe this Medicine but ſuch as have ſtrong Bodies, and be firſt well adviſed by a skilful Phyſitian. The ſyrup of

By Clyſter or Suppoſitory, make the Child ſoluble. Take one ounce of fine Sugar, of Poony root, and Miſleto of the Oake, of each half a drachm: with as much oyl of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds as is ſufficient to make a Lohock, and let the Child lick often thereof.</p>

                  <p>The Palſie is cauſed by abundance of groſſe and clammy humours, which ſtop the ſinews, and hinder the animal faculty, that it cannot come from the Brain or fountain to the members.

                  <p>There need no more Signs to know this diſeaſe by, than what hath been declared in the explanation of it. This diſeaſe for the moſt part happeneth to old folk, and ſurprizeth them in the Winter time; therefore Phlebotomy for the moſt part is unneceſſary, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. If plenitude of humours or blood appear, open a vein, on the ſound ſide, draw blood ſparingly, leſt you cool the Body too much. Let what part ſoever of the Body be affected, yet you muſt not forget the Brain, but you muſt purge, corroborate, and ſtrengthen it. If you find the originall of the diſtemper in the Brain, you muſt apply Medicines, which have power to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, diſſolve, and diſcuſſe; ſuch as are deſcribed in the ſecond Chapter, for the cure of cold and phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick diſtempers of the Head.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115825:43"/> the decoction of Guiacum, and the bark of the ſame; and if you add Cephalick hearbs to theſe, it will be the better. This Decoction is commendable, <hi>viz.</hi> Take of Guiacum ground, two ounces; of the bark of the ſame, half an ounce: the root of China, and Salſapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla, of each two drachms: Saſafras, three drachms: Lignum Aloes, and Galanga, of each two ſcruples: the root of Angelica, Peony, and Fennel, of each two drachms: the ſeeds of Peony, and ſweet Fennel, of each one drachm: Betony, ground Pine, Sage, of each one handfull: the flowers of Lavender, Roſemary, Stechas, and Cowſlips, of each one pugil: Cinamons, and Polipodium of the Oake, of each half an ounce: Infuſe them in ſix quarts of water twenty four hours: then boil it gently to the conſumption of two quarts, ſtrein it, and add to the decoction of brown Sugar, candy, and ſyrup of Stechas, of each four ounces. Let the diſeaſed take half a pint in a morning, three or four mornings, as a preparative to purging, you muſt purge once in a week, with one of the aforenamed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; having reſpect to the age and ſtrength of your Patient, &amp; ſeaſon of the year. Or you may prepare the aforeſaid water by diſtillation, thus: Take of the ſimples aforenamed, and infuſe them 24 hours in four quarts of water, and two of White-wine: then diſtill them in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> (as you ſhall be taught in the fourth part of this Treatiſe) to a pound of this diſtilled water, add one ounce of the ſyrup of <hi>Staethas,</hi> and a drachm of <hi>Theriaca diateſſaron,</hi> divide it into three parts for three mornings.</p>
                  <p>It is convenient to ſet Cupping glaſſes to the part affected, without ſcarifying of it, but eaſily drawing the humours and ſpirits to the place: afterwards you muſt rub and chafe the parts: it is convenient to bathe the paralytick part, and cauſe it to ſweat with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SPaſmus,</hi> Cramp, or Convulſion, is a diſeaſe, when the Sinews are drawn or plucked up againſt a mans will. Of this there are two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> a true Convulſion, when there is a conſtant retraction of the Muſcles, and the Limb remains unmoveable: or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive motion, when the retraction is every time new, and the Members moved divers ways. They differ likewiſe in their Cauſes, for a true Convulſion procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, either from repletion, or inanition; a convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive-motion, from irritation, or provocation. Again, they are thus divided, a true Convulſion is either total, by which moſt part of the Body is contracted, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, by which one particular member ſuffereth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. The Univerſal Convulſion is cauſed from the Brain, when the Face is plucked together as well as the whole Body, or from the marrow of the Back, when the Muſcles that move the Head and Back, are drawn together. A particular Convulſion is made from the contraction of the Muſcle of ſome part, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the hurt of that Nerve which is ordained for his motion. The immediate Cauſes (as I ſaid before) is repletion, or inanition; the Nerves being too full of moiſture, or too dry, are extended or contracted, and the Muſcles into which they are united, are, by that means drawn back to their original.</p>
               <p>The mediate Cauſes of a Convulſion, proceeding from repletion, are flegm, and wateriſh humours ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Nerves, ſtretching them in breadth, muſt conſequently make them ſhorter, and ſometimes cauſe an inflammation.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:115825:45"/>
               <p>But here in the way lyeth an Objection, namely, why a watery humor obſtructing the Nerves, and the cauſe of the Palſie and Conuvlſion, ſhould ſometimes bring one, and ſometimes the other: the humour of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, and the parts affected, being one and the ſame. The diverſe opinions, and long diſputations of writers, I ſhall not here repeat; the difficulty of the matter having diſtracted them into divers opinions. I ſhall anſwer the objection briefly, and adhere to the moſt able, modern Phyſicians, and ſay they differ thus: A Palſie is cauſed of a pure watery humour without mixture, which ſofteneth the Nerves, extends them not: The Convulſion is cauſed of the ſame humour, but mixed with much wind, by which the Nerves are ſtretched, and the Muſcles contracted to their original. It is the opinion of all Phyſitians, that wind is the cauſe of Convulſions; and experience teacheth us, that the greateſt diſtentions are cauſed by wind, as we ſee in the Dropſie, Tympanites, and the Chollick. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an inflammation, in or near the original of the Nerves, may cauſe a contraction of thoſe Nervous parts; and the cauſe of this inflammation is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times internal as a flux of blood upon the part; or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, by a wound, contuſion, or bruiſe.</p>
               <p>The Cauſes of a Convulſion by emptineſs, are all immoderate evacuations whatſoever, diſeaſes, diet, and Medicines which are hot and dry.</p>
               <p>A convulſive motion is cauſed by humours, or vapours which are full of Acrimony, or Malignancy: and it ſometimes ſo happeneth in malignant Feavers; and Diſeaſes of choller occupying the Head, or Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid, it is eaſie to know a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion proceeding from fulneſſe or emptineſſe, or convulſive motion. A Convulſion near the Brain is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115825:45"/> dangerous; in the Muſcles of the breſt, gives fear of ſuffocation: If it come after bleeding or purging, it is deadly: So is a Convulſion, following a Frenſie. A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion coming upon a Fever, ſhews malignant matter which ends in death: but if a Feaver follow a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, it taketh away its cauſe,</p>
               <p>The cure of this diſeaſe is as various as the cauſe: The Convulſion cauſed by emptineſſe requires moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening medicines, both internall and externall: This diſeaſe ſeldome happening, and almoſt (if not altogether incurable) I ſhall ſay nothing of it.</p>
               <p>A Convulſion comming of repletion or fullneſſe muſt be cured by evacuation of the pecant humours; if you ſee occaſion, make uſe of Phlebotomie, and purge the humours with medicines agreeable to the age and ſtrength of your Patient: and ſomtimes with ſharp Clyſters, ſuch as are deſcribed in the fifth Chapter. If you ſee it not convenient to let blood, apply Cupping-glaſſes, alwaies above the parts griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſo the humours may be brought back to their originall; that is to ſay, if the Convulſion or Cramp be in the Leggs, apply them to the Buttocks and Loines; obſerve the ſame rule, where ever it be. The part affected ought to be chafed with oyles and oyntments ſutable to ſuch a diſtemper, <hi>viz.</hi> the oyles of Rue, Camomill, Dill, Spike, the oyle of Foxes, &amp;c: the oyntments of Marſh-Mallows, <hi>Martiatum, Nervinum,</hi> to which may be added the Mucilage of Briony, with which you may make convenient Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to anoint the parts affected, and the root of the Nerve which comes to it.

Or you may make it ſtronger, thus: Take of the aforeſaid dripping ſix ounces; The Chimicall oyles of wax, Nutmegs, and Sage, of each two drachms, mix it and make a Liniment: when you have anoynted the part affected, cover it with a hot ſheeps skin, a Hares or Foxes skin. To put the part affected into an Oxe or Sheeps belly, or any other newly killed; or to apply the Lungs of a Sheep; yong Pidgeons, Whelps or Chickens ſlit in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, is much commended, and hath been ſucceſſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved. For thoſe that are thus affected, it is very good to bathe themſelves in the Bath of <hi>Bath,</hi> or ſuch like, proceeding from a ſulphureous Mine: If you cannot conveniently come to this Bath, you muſt make a Bath with theſethings following. Of Marſh-mallow roots and Lillys of each two pound: Of the leaves of Penniroyall, Lawrell, Rue, Marjerome, St. Johns wort, Violets, Mallows, Sage and Wormwood, of each two handfulls: Linſeeds, and Fenugreek, of each one pound, boyle all theſe in water ſufficient to make a bath, and let the party diſeaſed ſit therein, not too long, but let him come out as ſoone as he finds eaſe. If you dare venture to be at the coſt, make your bath, with oyle, boyling a Fox therein, together with the aforeſaid hearbs, you may purge the head with ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutations, Gargariſms, and ſuch medicines as you may find in the ſecond Chapter, for the cure of a cold Phlegmatick diſtemper of the braine: and it is good

The braine requiring much nouriſhment, muſt neceſſarily void much excrements, which if they are in quantity moderate, and naturall, they are received into the fore-Ventricles, and conveid to the moiſt gladules, and ſpit out from the Palat; If it grow more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet naturall, it is diſperſed through the films of the brain, and ſent forth by the Noſtrill as well as the Palat. But when the brain is weak, and affected with diſtempers, and receiveth more nouriſhment then
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115825:47"/> it can concoct, it aboundeth with excrements, which by their quality and quantity overcome the retentive, and provoke the expulſive faculties, and ſo evacuate themſelves by unuſuall and improper wayes, to the diſturbance of the whole body.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of this diſtemper proceeds from want of a good concoction in the brain, and this proceeds either from a hot or cold diſtemper.</p>
               <p>A hot diſtemper doth attract more nouriſhment then nature can ſufficiently digeſt. A cold diſtemper turneth the nouriſhment, brought to the brain, to flegme or water. Cold, groſſe, and ſlimy meats hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a good concoction, and windy meats ſend up many vapours to the head.</p>
               <p>Add to theſe many externall cauſes, as Southerly winds, long ſleepe upon a full ſtomach, eſpecially an idle life, &amp;c. And though this be accounted a diſeaſe of the head, yet the principall cauſe lyeth in the inferiour parts, in which evill humours are collected, as the Liver, Spleen, Meſentery, Womb, &amp;c. from whom, not only vapours, but even the humours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are ſent to the head, and deſcend to the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our parts againe; a hot diſtemper of the Bowells, like an Alembeck ſend continuall vapours to the head; a cold diſtemper engenders crude humours, which are alſo many times drawn up thither. Coſtiveneſſe or obſtructions in the lower belly, which hinder the avoiding of excrements, they not finding their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary paſſage fly up to the braine, which, by reaſon of its weakneſſe, and looſe and ſoft ſubſtance, is forced to yeeld to the ſtronger parts disburthening themſelves upon it. The Impulſive cauſes are too much heat or cold in the braine: too much heat doth extenuate and diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe the humours, and this happeneth to the head, heated by the Sun, fire, covering, &amp;c. Coldneſſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115825:47"/> doth compreſſe the head, and ſtraines forth the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours therein contained, as a ſpunge is ſqueeſed in the hand. A Catarrh is cauſed by a Communication of cold humours, to the braine, from the feet, conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the chiefeſt Nerves, which run through the Marrow of the back: The ſtoppage or cloſure of the externall pores, when the body requireth ſweat is the cauſe of a Catarrh; hence it commeth to paſſe that Catarrhs are moſt frequent in Autumne, <hi>viz.</hi> the body being made thin in the Summer, and the pores open, evacuating excrements by ſweat and inſenſible tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration: in Autmune the pores being ſudainly ſtopt, by reaſon of the contraction of ſudaine cold, which cauſeth many vapours to fly to the head. Many more cauſes might be inſtanced, but I fear I ſhall grow too voluminous, and what I have ſaid is ſufficient to ſtirr up ingenious wits to further diſcoveries. I ſhall add a few words, of the nature of the parts receiving this Defluxion, which by reaſon of their weakneſſe are forced to receive the burthen laid upon them, by the ſtronger parts, like the inferiour Commons, who are forced to bear the heavy impoſitions of their inſulting Superiours. The Lungs is naturally weak by reaſon of its ſoftneſſe and looſeneſſe, which maketh the part ſit to receive Defluxions; want of naturall heat, cauſed by a cold diſtemper, maketh the part unable to reſiſt Defluxions: A wound or Ulcer in the part, cauſeth the humours to flow thither, if you take notice of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, and Cauteries, you will ſcarcely doubt of the truth of it: So doth any inflammation or unnaturall heat in the Lungs; Conſider of this and you may be able to give a reaſon of conſumptions of the Lungs, Plureſies, and ſpitting of bloody matter. The humours, which cauſe a Catarrh, flow from the brain internally or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally: internally, if the humours fall upon the breaſt,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115825:48"/> it is called a Catarrh or Defluxion: If upon <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> it is called <hi>Raucedo</hi> or hoarſneſſe: If it flows into the Noſtrills, it cauſeth <hi>Coryza, Ozena,</hi> or Polypus: If it falls upon the Nerves, it produceth numbneſſe, Palſy, Convulſion, trembling; if in the Eares, deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; if in the eyes, Inflamation, Teares, blindneſſe; if upon the Uvula or Palat it cauſeth a ſwelling, loof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or Ulcer there: if it fall into the throat, the Quinſie follows; if on the Lungs, Inflammation, Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie, ſhortneſſe of breath, Cough, Conſumption. If it falls into the Stomach, vomiting and want of appetite enſues, if into the bowells, Dyarrhea, or Dyſentery: and ſometimes it floweth into the Veins with the blood and cauſeth a Feaver called Febris Catarrhalis, and is the fore-runner of the joynt gout, and Eryſipelas. Sometimes the humours flow from the head exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, without the skull under the skin; theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours fall into the Eyes, Teeth, Neck, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall parts: therefore it is rightly conceived, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned men, that the greateſt part of the diſeaſes, incident to the body of man, have their originall from the head: Such whoſe bodys are ſpare and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, eaſily penetrated by heat or cold; or ſuch as are groſſely compact, and have not free tranſpiration: Such who have weak and cold braines, that cannot diſcuſſe, nor concoct the humours or vapours therein contained; or thoſe whoſe braines are ſo hot as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract too many vapours; Such, whoſe Stomachs and Livers are contrary in quality, <hi>viz.</hi> one hot, the other cold, are men ſubject to Catarrhs or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions.</p>
               <p>The ſigne of this diſeaſe may eaſily be gathered from the Cauſes, the approach of this diſeaſe may be diſcovered by the following Symptoms, <hi>viz.</hi> by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe of the head, dullneſſe of the ſenſes, long ſleep,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115825:48"/> a ſnotty noſe, much ſpitting, coſtiveneſſe of the body, and much wind; when the diſeaſe is perfect, the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humours are plainly felt, with ſwellings and paines in divers parts: If the defluxion be of cold humours, then will the body be ſenſible of cold, the face pale, the habit of the body generally flegmatick, troubled with ſoure belchings, ſweet, ſlimy and wateriſh ſpittle. If it be a hot diſtillation, the habit of the whole body is Cholerick; the parts affected inflamed and painfull, the face red, much thirſt, a ſalt and ſharp humour in the mouth. I need not tell you how an externall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion may be knowne from an internall, but take notice, that if there appeare plenty of humours, the Catarrh is more dangerous, for by a ſuddaine defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deſperate accidents may follow.</p>
               <p>If age, ſtrength, and the ſeaſon permit, or if the body abound with blood, or the Liver be too hot, (as it often happens in this diſtemper) breathe a veine at the beginning of the cure, the contrary prohibiting Phlebotomy. You muſt firſt prepare the matter, then gently purge the head, afterwards more ſtrongly purge the peccant humours: out of the former Chapters you may find, what purges are convenient, with reſpect to the humour offending, <hi>Coloquintida</hi> hath an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent faculty to purge the head, but by reaſon of its violent operation, is not fit for common uſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſe it not without good advice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In this diſeaſe alſo it is good to uſe Maſticatories, and Gargariſmes, when the humours fall into the eyes or noſe, &amp;c. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhines,</hi> and ſneeſing powders when it falls upon the Breaſt, Lungs, &amp;c. Iſſues behind the neck or eares are found, by experience, a gallant remedy for a Catarrh. I ſhall not here trouble my ſelfe or the reader, to inſert examples of the aforegoing medicines; the Chapters beforegoing, together with every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115825:49"/> ingenuity will ſufficiently inſorme. Take this for a generall rule, that when a Catarrh or Deflaxion is cauſed by excrementitious humours, flowing from any of the inferior parts, by reaſon of the naturall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, being ſtopped, you muſt open the obſtruction, by often purging, or by medicines regarding the nature of the obſtruction, and by that meanes turn the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours offending into their naturall channell; after convenient Evacuations, with internall and externall medicines. labour to corroborate the head, and dry up the humours, Internall medicines may be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thus, or after this manner. Take of Coriander ſeed prepared, and Coltsfoot dryed, Nutmegs, and Frankinſence of each halfe an ounce; Liquoris, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick and Cubebs, of each two drachms, <hi>flos</hi> Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, three drachms: Conſerve of red Roſes one ounce, with a pound of white Sugar diſſolved in Popy-water make rolls, weighing three drachms or half an ounce: Take one morning and Evening. Or you may make Troches in this manner, Take of the beſt Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and juice of Liquoris, of each one drachm: Lac Sulphuris, half a drachm: Opium, Saffron, and Mirrh of each one ſcruple; the oyles of Anniſe-ſeed and Nutmegs, of each three drops, with <hi>Diacedium,</hi> as much as ſufficeth, to make Troches; or if you pleaſe you may make them into pills: and take halfe a drachm morning and evening. It is good to apply bags of hearbs to the fore part of the head, which have a dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quality, ſhave the fore part of the head, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the <hi>gum Sacamahaca,</hi> ſpread upon a cloath in the forme of a plaiſter, and add thereto a little Mirrh; or if you make a fume thereof, and ſhut the Chamber cloſe, it profiteth. If the defluxion proceed from a hot cauſe, you muſt adminiſter medicines, which have power to thicken the humours, to repel, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115825:49"/> evacuate it: you muſt likewiſe correct the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and fortifie the parts both ſending and receiving, and that you may ſo do, you muſt revel or pull b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ck the humours by Phlebotomy, if nothing hinder it. You muſt thicken the humours, by adminiſtring Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps, made of the Waters of Plantane, Purſlane, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; the Sirrups of Poppies, Violets, Water-Lillies, of dryed Roſes, and Meconium, and ſuch like. Having thus thickned and prepared the humours, you muſt evacuate them by gentle Purgatives; Take of the Beſtrhabarb a drachm, infuſe lit in any of the afore-named waters (as much as is ſufficient for a potion) ſix hours in warm Embers, ſtrain it out, and add to the liquour one ounce of Manna, and as much Sirrup of dryed Roſes, and adminiſter it: To make the potion ſtronger, you may diſſolve therein Catholicon, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pranam Solative, or Lenitive, Confectio Hamech, &amp;c. or ſuch like, having reſpect to the age and ſtrength of your Patient, and humour offending. You muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reſtrain the Flux thus; take of Conſerve of Roſes one ounce, Diatraganthum Frigidum, and Palyis Haly, of each a drachm, Bolearmenick prepared with Roſe-water a drachm; with the Emulſion of the four great cold Seeds, and Sirrup of dryed Roſes, make an Opiate, and give the quantity of a Nutmeg to bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Theſe Troches are much commended, take Gum-Dragant, and Arabick, of each two drams: Bole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armenick, and Terra Sigillata waſhed in Roſewater, of each one drachm; White Poppy ſeeds, and Juyce of Liquoriſh, of each half a drachm; Sugar-penid one ounce, with the Muſilage of Quince-ſeeds, extracted with Roſewater, make Troches to be held in in the mouth day and night.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of Sulphur, and Vitriol given three or four drops in a convenient Julep, morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115825:50"/> worketh no ſmall effects againſt a defluxion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if it proceed from an inflammation of the bowels. If you find the Diſeaſe too ſtubborn to yield to theſe medicines, you muſt make uſe of Narcoticks, of which Laudanum is none of the worſt, four or five grains given at bed-time. <hi>Faventius</hi> extolleth theſe Pills in a Salt Catarrh, or defluxion of ſalt humours. Take of the juyce of Liquoris two drachms, waſhed Aloes one drachm, Pillulae de Cynogloſſo half a drachm, with Sirrup of Violets, make a Maſs, and take a ſcruple thereof at bed-time. It is convenient to make pouders to apply to the head, which have power to ſtrengthen, to ſtop the defluxion, and conſume the humours. Take of white Amber, Benjamin, Maſtich, Nutmegs, of each half an ounce: Betony, Sage, Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, Lavender, Marjarome, of each half a handful: Frankinſenſe, graits of Kermes, Red-roſes, Peony ſeeds and Poppy heads, of each two drachms: Sanders, Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, Cyprus nuts, and Pomegranate flowers, of each one drachm; make a powder for the lining of a Cap or Quilt: or if you had rather, you may make a plaiſter with the ſame Simples, with Wax and Oyl of Rofes, according to art: and apply it to the head, being firſt ſhaved.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of Diſeaſes of the Eyes, and firſt of the Diſeaſes procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from Obſtruction in the Optick Nerves.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the former book having given you a brief account of this worthy member, and what varicty of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful operations, God and Nature hath placed in ſo little a ſubject; yet of the parts and faculties thereof, it is too hard a task for the moſt exquiſite Philoſopher to conceive aright; or for the moſt eloquent Orator, to expreſs ſuch wonderful notions: But, ſeeing God hath indued every man with this member, by whoſe curious inſpection, he is inabled to pry into all things; it is the duty of every Naturaliſt to exerciſe this member in finding out its own conſtitution, and curing the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and maladies, to which it is ſubject. For the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of thoſe, who want better helps, I ſhall, as briefly as may be, diſcover the diſeaſes and cures of the eye, as they are, in which work I adhere to the opinions of the wiſe and learned Phyſitians, verified by Reaſon, and my own Experience.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it happeneth, that the ſight of the eye is totally extinguiſhed, and no fault appears in the eye: And this cometh to paſs, either by obſtruction or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction of the Optick Nerves; and is called by the Latines, <hi>Gutta Serena,</hi> and <hi>Amaureſis.</hi> Obſtruction (for the moſt part) is the cauſe of this Diſeaſe, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth by the flowing down of a watry humour upon the Nerves, which cauſeth blindneſs, or dimneſs of ſight: the like obſtruction happening to the other Nervs, cauſeth the Palſie. Adſtriction or compreſſion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happeneth by ſome moiſt humour gathered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115825:51"/> the Optick Nerves, as blood or filthy matter, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered In the brain, ſometimes bp humours, ſometimes by inflammation, in malignant Feavers, and may be the cauſe of this Diſeaſe. For the Nerves being thus obſtructed or compreſſed, the animal Spirits cannos paſs from the brain to the eyes. To this I may add, that in caſe by a wound in the head, the Optick Nerves be cut, without controverſie it cauſeth blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The ſign of this Diſeaſe, is the loſs of ſight, and the eye appearing in its natural condition, onely the Pupilla, or ſight of the eye, looketh wider, blacker, and dimmer: the difference of cauſes is thus known: If the cauſe be blood or choler, ſome inflammation, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume, or wound in the head hath gone before. If the Nerves are compreſſed by Flegme, gathered about the roots of the eyes, all or moſt of the head is affected, and the other ſenſes are hurt: but if it be obſtruction of the Optick Nerves, the eye is onely affected, or the fore-part of the head about the eye-hrows, beareth part of the affliction. If the Diſeaſe proceed from an obſtruction in the Optick Nerves, and the ſight be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally loſt, for the moſt part the Diſeaſe is incurable: but if the obſtruction be imperfect, that is to ſay, the ſight much diminiſhed, and the Patient not totally blind, then there is hope of recovery. If it happen by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours gathered into the fore-part of the head, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Nerves, it is curable.</p>
               <p>For the Cure, the head muſt be cleanſed by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which effectually purge thoſe humours, which compreſs or obſtruct the Nerves; but remember, that as you cannot free the Nerves, without purging the whole head, ſo you cannot cleanſe the head without purging the whole body. It is good that the Patient avoid a thick, cold, cloudy, and moiſt ayr, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the contrary. Let him eſchew all meats that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115825:51"/> are groſs, or yield a groſs juyce, ſuch as are windy, hot ſpices, or whatever fills the head with vapours. It is good to put the ſeed of Fenel into his bread. Let his meat for his ſauce be extenuating, as Betony, Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bright, Fenel, Hyſop, Marjarom, Sage: Nutmeg alſo doth much comfort the brain, and clears the ſight, as 'tis generally believed: Let the aforeſaid hearbs likewiſe be boiled in his broth: Lettice and ſuch ilke cold herbs are very hurtful; Turneps are highly commended, and 'tis proved they clear the ſight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often eaten: Pidgeons, Sparrows, and ſuch like Fowls are ſaid to be a good food for ſuch who are thus diſeaſed. Let him eat no Supper, if he eat any, let it be light, and not too late. Then let him make uſe of this Diet-drink following. Take of Bettony, Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bright, Celandine the great, Fenel, Balm, Marjarom, Sage, and Vervain, of each two handfuls: the roots of Elecompane, Fenel, Flowerdeluce, Liquoris, and Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaparilla ſliced, of each one handful: the Seeds of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander, Anice, and Fenel, of each one ounce: the ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of Roſ-mary and Lavender, of each a handful: Raiſons of the Sun ſtoned, and blew Figs ſliced, of each a pound: Senna two ounces: Let all theſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſix hours, in a ſufficient quantity of Wort, upon hot Embers, then tunned up in four gallons of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, let them work together: Let the Patient drink a draught every morning till the Cure be perfected, unleſs ſome other medicine intervene. You muſt purge the body often, as you ſee cauſe, either with gentle or ſtronger purges; let them be Pills, and ſuch as purge the humour oftending; of which you ſhall have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account in the fourth book.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:115825:52"/>
               <p>If your Patient be not old, and you finde blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, you may open a vein: the opening of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular veins of the head, eſpecially thoſe that are nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt the eyes, have often proved ſucceſsful, becauſe the veins, by reaſon of their fulneſs of blood, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the Optick Nerves.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the application of Cupping-glaſſes, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicatories, and Cauteries, to the hinder part of the head or neck, to the ſhoulders or back, have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with admirable ſucceſs. After due evacuation, it is convenient to dry up the humours by a ſudorifick Diet-drink, made and uſed, as is deſcribed in the ſecond Chapter; adding ſuch hearbs, as have a ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to cure the eyes, <hi>viz.</hi> Celandine, Ey-bright, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and Vervain. If you ſee occaſion to dry up the moiſt humours of the head, make uſe of ſuch powders, bags, and caps preſcribed in the fore-poing Chapters. Alſo ſulphurous and Bituminous Bathes profit much.</p>
               <p>The Gloſſie and Cryſtalline humours of the Eye are ſubject to infirmities and diſorder: the firſt is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a mixture, with other humours; and this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is hard to diſcover; but muſt be cured by clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the head and optick nerves, and repelling and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing the humour, which mixeth with the vitrous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and maketh it dusky. This humour alſo may be diſordered, in reſpect of its ſcituation, when it is brought before the Cryſtalline, and ſo diminiſheth the ſight. This Diſeaſe is hardly diſtinguiſhed from a Cataract, onely it differeth in the cauſe; for a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract cometh by a defluxion of humour; this from a blow or contuſion, and is uncurable: ſometimes it happeneth that Nature works a cure, and reduceth it to its place again; but no man as yet can imitate her, therefore we leave the buſineſs to her diſpoſing.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:115825:52"/>
               <p>The Cryſtalline humour is the chief inſtrument of ſight, and if any defect happen to it, that it be not pure nor perſpicuous, the viſive ſpirits cannot exerciſe their office. This humour doth often ſuffer prejudice through ſome drying and condenſing cauſe, as it often happens to ancient people, where the aforeſaid cauſe changeth the Cryſtaline humour to redneſs. The ſign of this Diſeaſe is a thick White about the ſight of the Eye, and every object appeareth to the Patient as through a Cloud: It is called Glaucoma, and differeth from a Cataract in this, <hi>viz.</hi> a Cataract lyeth in the Pupilla, or ſight near Cornea, but Glaucoma lyeth much deeper, and is uncurable, eſpecially in old peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Somtimes the Cryſtalline humour is diſplaced, that it lyeth not directly againſt the Pupilla; ſometimes it lyeth too high, and ſometimes too low; and if one eye ſuffer, all things ſeem double: ſometimes vapours and water divide the viſive humours, and cauſeth the objects to be received into two places. Sometimes the Cryſtalline humour is removed and brought nearer to the Pupilla, and things that are near, are not ſo eaſily ſeen, as things farther of. But if it be removed back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, things near are plainly ſeen, but not afar of; the uſe of Spectacles are profitable in this caſe. Sometimes the Cryſtalline humour lyeth to the right, or to the left ſide, ſo that more White appeareth on one ſide, then on the other, and this we call Strabiſmus, or Squinting, this alſo is uncurable, unleſs it happeneth that the muſcles of the eyes be diſplaced by convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or palſie, for if it ſo happeneth, it is uncurable. Sometimes there happeneth an inverſion of the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline humour, ſo that the objects ſeem ſoulded or crooked: But theſe Diſeaſes being uncurable by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, I ſhall preſcribe none.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of a Cataract.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A Cataract is cauſed or bred by a diſtemper of the watry humour of the eye, which diſtemper is in quantity or quality: if in quantity, it cauſeth a dilatation of the Pupilla; of which I ſhall ſpeak in the next Chapter. If the diſtemper be in quality, it proceeds from a mixture of excrementitious humours with the watry humour: In the beginning of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, the ſight being a little darkened, it is called Suffuſion; but when it is gathered about the Pupilla (like water) they call it Aqua-water; but when it is gathered thick about the Pupilla, it is called a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract. If Choler be the humour mixed with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try humour, the Cataract appeareth ſomewhat citrine or yellow: if melancholy, then is the Cataract more dull and blackiſh: If it be white as chalk, it ſignifieth a thick and compacted matter: if it be of the colour of Pearl, then ſlime and tranſparent flegme is the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour offending.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of Cataracts, a true, and a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-cataract: A true Cataract doth for the moſt part effect one eye onely; and if both be affected, they are not alike, nor affected at the ſame time, as in the ſpurious Cataract. In a true Cataract, or Suftnſion, a derk matter appeareth in the Pupilla, which doth not in the other. But here let the Reader beware, leſt he fall into error; for this doth not always hold, as a ſure diſtinguiſhing rule: for if the humour be as thin as the warry humour, nothing appeareth; and many upon
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115825:53"/> this ground have thought it to be Gutta Serena: but there is a great difference between Gutta Serena, and this: for in Gutta Serena the ſight is quite left, or at leaſt much diminiſhed, and no fault appear in the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilla: But it is not ſo in this Suffuſion, which cannot be ſeen; for the ſight is but a little diminiſhed, becauſe the humour being thin and tranſparent, the objects pierce it like glaſs.</p>
               <p>Though I need ſay nothing of the ſigns of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, it being eaſie to gather the ſigns from the cauſes, yet I ſhall and a few words. In the beginning of a Suffuſion, certain ſmall Bodges, as hairs, flyes, cobwebs, gnats, wool, and ſuch like, ſly before the eyes, as it grows on the ſymptomes, are more evident, and the objects appear as through a glaſs, when it is perfect: the Pupilla is changed in colour, and the ſight is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally loſt: what the colours denote, I have already laid down. If the matter of the Cataract appear dark, it lyeth between Chorion (or Uyea) and Cornea, and the Pupilla is dilated, and white or red veins appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the circle of the eye: if the contrary appear, judge that the matter lyeth between the Chriſtalline, and Uvea. If the matter lye deep, the Pupilla is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, if higher enlarged. When the Cataract if newly begun, and the Patient can ſee, as thoug a clad; if he be young, and the ſeaſon ſutable, it may be cured: On the contrary, if it be confirmed, and the matter groſs, it yields not to medicines, but muſt be couched with a needle.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing I ſpeak of couching give me leave to tell you, that 'tis a dangerous operation, and often atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with bad ſucceſs; but if you finde it needful, and likely to be prevalent, make uſe of a near-handed Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon; and that you may know, whether it be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or no to be cured, conſider a few rules. Sign. of care,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115825:54"/> by couching, are theſe: If when the ſound eye be ſhut, the Pupilla of the eye affected appear larger, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome light, there is hopes of cure: if the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appear, judge accordingly. A black, green, yellow, and hard Cataract, never yieldeth to medicine, ſeldome to the Needle: Attempt not the operation on old men, nor children: You muſt alſo conſider, before you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt this operation, whether the Suffuſion be ripe and ſit for couching; or whether it be not grown too hard. The firſt you muſt try thus; preſs down the eye affected with your finger, and if you alter the ſhape of the, Suffuſion, and when your finger is off it, returneth to its former ſtation, then is it thin, and not ripe: but it the contrary appear, it may be couched with a Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: But here note, that it muſt be moderate, and not too compact, but like a skin that will rowl upon the Needle; if it be thick and ſolid like chalk, or hail, it cannot be couched.</p>
               <p>For the cure, you muſt obſerve the ſame rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the former Chapter, you muſt uſe and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from the ſame kind of diet; you muſt uſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and particular Evacuations; you muſt revel the humours offending, and ſtrengthen the head and eyes. Then you muſt come to Topical medicines, and though I am (almoſt) of <hi>Galens</hi> opinion, who ſaith they are little worth, for they promiſe more then they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, yet Experience hath taught, and Authors have confirmed, that Cataracts, which have not been of long continuance, but taken in the beginning, have been cured by Topicks, after the uſe of the medicines before mentioned; therefore I ſhall inſert a few of them, and leave the Ingenious to find out more.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you muſt make a Fomentation of ſuch things, as have power to mollifie and diſſolve: Take of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendine, Fenel, Eye-bright, of each one handful; of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115825:54"/> Rue, Vervain, Clary, of each half a handful; Melilot, Chamomel Flowers, and Red-Roſe leaves, of each one pugil: Fenugreek ſeed one ounce: boil them in a pint and a half of Spring water, to the conſumption of the half pint, then put in a half pint of White-Wine, and let it boil a little. Strein it out, and with clothes wet it in the liquor, ſoment the eyes every morning, ſo long as you ſee occaſion. If you waſh the eyes with Red-Wine, ſometimes it hinders the defluxion, diſcuſſeth and diſſolveth. It is good to let a child lick the eye, after it hath eaten ſweet Fenel ſeeds. Infuſe Crocus Metallorum in White-Wine, and waſh the eye with the Wine; or after a ſufficient infuſion, pour off the Wine clear, and with ſweet Fenel and Fenugreek ſeed, of each one ounce; of Aloes half an ounce, Saffron a drachm; beat them, and ſearſe them into fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the blood of a young Pidgeon hot, the weight of them all, with the aforeſaid Wine, what is ſufficient to make a ſoft Pultis, and apply it warm to the eye at night; take it off in the morning. Or ſlit a young Pid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and lay it to the eye. Then you muſt come to make uſe of Topical Medicines called Collyries, which many times (by <hi>Galens</hi> favour) hath good ſucceſs, if the Cataract be not too much confirmed Take the leaves of Rue, Fenel, Vervain, Celendine, and Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bright, of each one handful; Centaury the leſs, Burnet, Avens, Sage, of each a half handful; Fenel roots, and the roots of round Birthwort, of each a half pound; Red roſe leaves, and White-violet leaves, of each one ounce; Radiſh ſeed, and Fenugreek ſeed, of each one drachm; Ammoniacum, and the Natural Balſome, of each a drachm; Tutty two drachms: pouder thoſe that are to be poudered the heaths and roots ſhred and ſliced; put to them White-Wine, honey, and the urine
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115825:55"/> of a Boy, as much as may wet them all, <hi>viz.</hi> Of White Wine three parts; of the Urine two, and honey one; then diſtil them in <hi>Balneo Marîae:</hi> drop the water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eyes, morning and evening: regarding the courſe and medicines before preſcribed. <hi>Joſephus Quercetanus,</hi> in his <hi>Pharmacopaea,</hi> doth much commend this following Water, <hi>viz.</hi> Take of the water of the greater Celandine ſix ounces. Crocus Metallorum one drachm; infuſe it in the ſame water, and drop two or three drops into the eye, three or four times a day as long as need requireth.</p>
               <p>I could inſert many more Receipts of Learned and able men, but I fear my Book will ſwell too big: I ſhall onely inſert the Ointment of <hi>Zacutus Laſitanas,</hi> which he commends, for drying and purging the moiffure flowing into the eyes: Take of the Oyl of Roſes three ounces, white Roſe-water nine ounces: Camphire one drachm, Tutty one ſcruple, Honey two ounces, the Gall of a Goat half an ounce, Lupin meat half a drachm, Aloes Succotrine one dram, Sugar-can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy half a drachm, the juyce of Horehound, Fennel, and Rue, of each half an ounce, Mirrh one ſcruple, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacum half a drachm, Saicocol one dram and a half.</p>
               <p>Pouder them that are to be poudered, mixe them, and boil them a little with a gentle fire; and with the greaſe of a Goat or Sheep, and a little Wax, make an Ointment accorbing to Art; anoint the Eye-brows twice in a day, three hours after meat, which will purg plenty of water out of the head, through the corner of the eye.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Of the enlarging, and dilating: of the ſtraitening or contracting of the Pupilla.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis Diſeaſe is called in Greek <hi>Mydriaſis,</hi> becauſe too much light going in, hurteth the ſight: hence it is, that thoſe that are thus diſtempered, ſee better in a darkiſh place than in the light. And this may be demonſtrated by the natural change of the Pupilla (in ſound eyes) in bright and obſcure places. For when a man is in a bright and clear place, the Pupilla is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and made leſs, leſt the light, going in too faſt, ſhould diſſipate the ſpirits: ſo that a man going ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly out of a very light place, into a houſe or place more obſcure, at the firſt entry he ſeeth (almoſt) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, the Pupilla being ſo lately contracted: he remaining in the ſame place, the Pupilla is ſoon dilated or enlarged to receive more light, and then he ſeeth perfectly thoſe things, which before he could not. Then if he go out ſuddenly into a very light place his eyes are dazled, and he ſeeth not perfectly, becauſe the Pupilla is enlarged, and the Light going in ſo faſt, doth diſſipate and diſpierſe the Viſive Spirits. Hence you perceive, that the Light ought to paſs into the Eye in a moderate quantity, and the Pupilla ought to be of a moderate ſize. Hence <hi>Galen</hi> obſerves, that they who are born with narrow Pupillas, ſee beſt.</p>
               <p>The Pupilla is enlarged, or contracted by dryneſs, or repletion. It is enlarged by dryneſs, which ſtretcheth the Uvea, which maketh the form of the Pupilla lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; as Leather being pierced, when it is dry, the hole
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115825:56"/> is larger, and this proceeds from Feavers, and ſuch drying Diſeaſes, which are attended with want of ſleep. So may the Pupilla be ſtraitned by dryneſs, when the Tunicle Uvea, by reaſon of the diminiſhing of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the Eye, loſeth its former extenſion, falls to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and is wrinkled, and ſo the hole of the Pupilla is made ſtreighter: whereas in the former the Tunicle though dry, holdeth its extenſion. It is made larger al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by repletion, namely by vapours or wind ſent unto the Eye, or by the extraordinary flowing of the watry and other humours to the eye, or by the ſwelling of Uvea it ſelf, it is diſtended, and the Pupilla made lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: So the ſame watry humour may work a contrary effect, namely by relaxing the ſame Tunicle, and by that means making the hole ſtreighter: The Pupilla is inlarged ſometimes by Convulſion, as may be ſeen by ſome Epileptick Children: Sometimes a ſtroak or fall, may cauſe a deflaxion into the eyes, hence comes extenſion; retenſion of the Spirits cauſeth wind and humours, and that cauſeth diſtenſion of the Pupilla, and ſometimes the Pupilla is made ſtreighter, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the want of the viſive ſpirits to extend the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, for want of which they are relaxed, and fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as may be ſeen in old men.</p>
               <p>Theſe Diſeaſes, though they are contrary, yet are to be cured by the ſame medicines; remember this, that if theſe Diſeaſes be of long continuance, and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient people, they are (without doubt) incurable. But if the Patient be young, and the Diſeaſe of no long continuance, you muſt proceed, with this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the cure muſt be varied according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of cauſes: If it proceed from dryneſs, you muſt refreſh the body with medicines which are moiſt and reſtaurative; and ſuch you ſhall finde in the cure of the Hective Feaver. If it comes from a humour filling
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115825:57"/> the Eye, you muſt purge and cleanſe the head and whole body of that humour, as you are taught in the cure of a Cataract. If from Wind, after due Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you muſt labour to diſcuſs the Wind, with the decoction of Fennel, Rue, Dill, Cammomel, Red-Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made in Red Roſe Water, and White-Wine, and the Eyes fomented therewith. If there be occaſion for Aſtriagent Medicines, to bring the Pupilla (being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged) to its former ſtate, make uſe of this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, taught by <hi>Ryverius.</hi> Take of Red-Roſes dryed two Scruples; Saffron, Spicknard, and the Bark of Frankinſenſe tree, of each half a ſcruple: Tutty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, Burnt-Ivory, and Acatia, of each one ſcruple: make them into fine pouder, and tie it up in a fine lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen rag, and hang it in three ounces of Red Roſe water; woen you have occaſion to uſe it, ſqueez the cloaih, and drop the water into the eyes, and waſh them therewith. If a blow in the eye cauſeth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, cure it as the inflammation of the eye: but if by the blow, the Pupilla be enlarged without inflammation, drop in a drop or two of Pidgeons blood: and apply a Cataplaſme, made with Bean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower, and Red-Roſes, juyce of Plantane, and Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe water.</p>

               <p>THE Tunicle, called Cornea, ſometimes loſeth its colour and brightneſs; ſomtimes it grows thick by drineſs, as in old men, and is incurable. Sometimes groſs humours are faſtened to it, by reaſon of inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Sometimes by reſolving Medicines, the thinner humours are diſſolved, and the thicker remain: or by the uſe of cold medicines, the humours are thickned, and a white humour is contracted, which is called by ſome <hi>Leucona;</hi> by others <hi>Albugo,</hi> commonly a Pin and Web. Sometimes it comes from a Sear, after an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and ſo the <hi>Cornea</hi> loſeth its tranſparentreſs. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Eye is bloud-ſhod, and that ſpoileth the natural colour of the <hi>Cornea,</hi> and this is called <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillatio:</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Cornea</hi> is made yellow by the Jaundiſe. All theſe Diſeaſes are eaſily diſcovered, and their cauſes are laid down in the Deſcription: That which cometh after a Wound or Ulcer, and is a Scar, is not eaſily cured. But the cure of the Pin and Web conſiſts in Emollients, attenuating and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing medicines. But the Antecedent cauſe muſt firſt be removed by univerſal evacuations, ſuch as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the 10. and 11. Chapters. Then you muſt ſoften the hard matter, with the decoction of Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek, Mallows, Melilot, Celendine, Fenel, and the like. Then let a Child chew ſweet Fenel-ſeed, and afterwards liek the eye, or make a Water thus: Take of Honey a pint, the juyce of Fenel-Brooklime, and Celendine, of each half a pint. Sugar-candy diſſolved in the juyces an ounce, with the natural Balſome a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115825:58"/> ſcruple; clarifie them together, or diſtil them in <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo Mariae,</hi> and drop it into the eye. The ſeed of <hi>Oculus Christi</hi> put into the eye, is good. If it be a ſcar, after the uſe of the former medicines, uſe the Water of Honey: afterwards, put a quantity of the Gall of an Ox to the Juyces before ſpoken of, and thicken it with Gum-Traganth. If the Eye be blood-ſhod, and yieldeth not to the fore-going medicine, you muſt ſeek its cure in the Chapter of the Cataract. As for the yellowneſs of the Eyes cauſed by the Jaundiſe, take away the cauſe, and the effect ceaſeth.</p>

               <p>For the cure, the external cauſes muſt be removed, the antecedent cauſes evacuated, revelled, and repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; the conjunct cauſe derived and diſcuſſed, and the parts affected, ſtrengthned.</p>
               <p>Let the Patient obſerve an orderly and temperate Diet, and eat ſuch things that are of eaſie diſgeſture, let him avoid all ſharp and ſalt things, and ſuch as fume up to the head, and ſuch things as breed Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler: Let him abſtain from ſtrong drink; let moſt of his drink be Barley water: Let him avoid all motion, let him lie ſtill as long as he is able, and ſleep as long as he can.

               <p>Phlebotomy for the moſt part is convenient, but let it be regulated and moderated according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ſtrength, age, and ſex of your Patient, and nature of the Diſeaſe.</p>

If one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one eye be affected, bleed your Patient on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide. If you finde a ſtoppage of any accuſtomed evacuations, <hi>viz.</hi> the Terms or Hemorroid veins; if the firſt be ſtopped, open the Saphaena; if the other, bleed them with Leeches.</p>

               <p>To make revulſion, ſome do apply Cupping-glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the ſhoulders and back: others open the veins of the head and temples, ſometimes the veins or the corners of the eyes, and behind the ears: and ſome bleed theſe veins by Leeches, all which are very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for derivation. When you have bled, and made ſufficient revulſion, you muſt purge the humour that offendeth, and cauſeth the blood to be inflamed; but firſt let the humours be prepared, then purge gently, and often; and if you ſee occaſion, after all this, you may purge more ſtrongly. Prepare the humours thus: Take of Endive, Succory, and Fumitory, of each one handful; Red. Roſe leaves one ounce; of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cold-ſeeds half an ounce; Of Lettice and Poppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds, of each two ſcruples: boil them in a quart of Spring water, to the conſumption of half, ſhrein it, and with Sirrup of Violets two ounces, and Sirrup of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory one ounce, make a Julep for three potions: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards you muſt adminiſter ſuch medicines, as have power gently to carry away the peccant humours. Take of Caſſia newly drawn, one ounce and a half: Manna diſſolved in Roſe-water an ounce: Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con half an ounce, Powder of Rubarb two drachms, with Sugar ſufficient, make a Bolus for three times. If the body be ſlagmatick, purge with pills of Agarick, or Lucis Majores; but take this caution along with you, that you adminiſter no ſtrong purgation in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, without the advice of an able Phyſition. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſufficient Evacuations, you may profirably apply a Cataplaſme to the forehead and temples, that hath an aſtringent power, by which the humours flowing to the eyes may be ſtopt: Take of Bolearmonick, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich, Frankinſence, Sanguis Draconis, and Wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower, of each one drachm; the powder of Lentils, and Red-Roſes, of each two ſeruples, with the White
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115825:60"/> of an egge, juyce of Nettles, Vinegar of Roſes, of each a like quantity, ſufficient to make a Cataplaſme. An Apple roaſted with Frankincenſe and Maſtick in it, moiſten it with the White of an Egg beaten to water, and as much of a ſound womans breaſt-milk, make a Cataplaſme, and apply it to the eye; or with crums of bread, and womans milk, with a little Roſe water, you may make a convenient Cataplaſme.</p>
               <p>Then you muſt prepare Collyries, Unguents, and Fomentations, which muſt be uſed with diſcretion, and varied as the pain or inflammation increaſeth, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, or as the humours are diſcuſſed or fixed, &amp;c. out of the multiplicity of ſuch medicines, I ſhal inſert a few, and but a few, for brevities ſake.</p>
               <p>Take the Salt of Lead one ſcruple, Sal-Armoniack ſix grains, Roſe-water and Plantine-water, of each three ounces, the White of an egge beaten to water, one ounce, let them be mixed therein, and the Salts well diſſolved, drop a little into the eye morning and evening. <hi>Quercetan</hi> commends the infuſion of Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Metallorum, made in Eye-bright, and Fenel-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and uſed as before. <hi>Paenotus</hi> his Ointment is very good in theſe ocular inflmamations; and the way to prepare it is thus: Take of Tutry prepared an ounce and a half, Camphire one drachm, Verdegreece 12. grains; beat the Tutty and the Camphire together in a morter, into fine powder, likewiſe the Verdegreece by it ſelf: then take of freſh butter (or <hi>May</hi> butter, if you can have it) one ounce, Roſewater one drachm; boil them gently together, then take them from the fire: firſt put in the Camphire and Tutty, then the Verdegreece by degrees, ſtir them well together, and ſtrein them through a piece of Sarſenet, put it into a glaſs, and keep it for your uſe: anoint the inſide of the eye-lids, eſpecially about the corners, and you ſhal
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115825:60"/> find eaſe, whether it be a moiſt or dry inflamation. If you make an Ointment of freſh butter, and juyce of Tobacco, you may do wonders in this caſe, but you muſt onely anoint the outſide of the eye lids. In the declination of the Diſeaſe, you may make a fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which hath a power to diſcuſſe and reſolve, of the decoction of Camomel, Melliot, Roſes, Eyebright, and Marjerom, and with clothes foment the eyes.</p>
               <p>If the Diſeaſe hath its original from a flegmatick humour, your reſolvents muſt be the ſtronger. Baths, alſo the drinking of Wine hath been approved, and much commended by <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> as a means to extenuate, diſſolve, diffuſe, and diſcuſs the thick humours gathered in the eyes, and to open ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. If you find that the Ophthalmy is cauſed by defects of the brain, by defluxion, or a hot diſtemper of the Liver, then labour firſt to remove the cauſe, as the ſeveral Chapters, thereof entreating, will inſtruct you.</p>
               <p>Sometimes if the humour cannot be reſolved, there is a ſuppuration and an Ulcer ſometimes followeth it, and ſometimes matter gathereth under the Cornea; this is called <hi>Hypopye,</hi> this cometh alſo ſometimes by a contuſion; ſometimes it covereth the Pupilla, and ſometimes compaſſeth the Circle of the eye, and is like a mans nail: Hence the Greeks call it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: This Diſeaſe is known by the inflamation going before; the matter is white under the Cornea, and when the eye is moved, it hath a motion. For the cure of this, you muſt (if any of the inflamation remain) uſe the aforegoing medicines; afterwards do as you are taught in the cure of a Cataract.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:115825:61"/>
               <p>Sometimes not onely in the Cornea, but alſo in the <hi>Adnata,</hi> little bliſters do ariſe, like little bubbles, like Pearls or Grumwel ſeed, it hath its original from a ſharp and watry humour: it is called <hi>Phlyctaenae:</hi> in the <hi>Adnata</hi> they are red, in the <hi>Cornea</hi> white within; but if they be on the outſide, they are black. They which are in <hi>Cornea</hi> are more dangerous, then thoſe that are in <hi>Adnata:</hi> and the more ſuperficial they are the leſs is the danger. The cure conſiſteth in the reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the matter conjoyned, and averting of the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent cauſe: labour to prevent a Suppuration, leſt an Ulcer follow. For the particular cure of this Diſeaſe, you muſt uſe thoſe medicines proper for the cure of the Ophthalmy.</p>
               <p>After an Ophthalmy, and bliſters in the eyes, ulcers ſometimes happen in the aforeſaid Tunicles; when the humours there gathered, or the bliſters come to ſuppuration: and ſometimes they follow ſharp, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding and watty humours flowing into the eys. Some of them are ſuperficial or profound, broad or narrow. A hollow narrow and hard Ulcer is called in Greek <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in Latine <hi>Foſſula,</hi> or a little Ditch. An Ulcer that is broad, and not ſo deep, is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; that which cometh in the Circle of the eye is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Ulcus coronale.</hi> They that are deep, ſolid, hard, and cruſty, are called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. If the Ulcer be in the Cornea, there will be a ſmall white blemiſh in the black of the eye: If it be in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata, there will be a ſmall red blemiſh in the white of the eye, becauſe the Adnata is full of blood. All Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the eyes are dangerous, and hard to cure, but more in the Cornea, than in the Adnata: If it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the? pilla, though it be cured, it much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceth the ſight, becauſe it leaveth a ſcar, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115825:61"/> the perſpicuity of the Cornea. For the Cure, you muſt uſe ſuch medicines as dry and cleanſe mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſuch as aſſwage pain, and revel, and reſtrain the humours flowing upon the eyes. You can ſcarcely read thus far, and be ignorant of particular medicines; yet for the benefit of the unskilful, I ſhall inſert one or two: Take an egg boiled hard, pilled and cut in two pieces: take out the yolk, and fill the hollow with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-candy, and Mirth in Powder, tie them laſt, and hang them up in a Cellar, and a Water will drop from it, which is good to cleanſe the eye without pain: the water of honey diſtilled, hath been found very effectual. But if theſe medicines are not ſtrong enough, do as followeth: Take of Plantane, Vervane, and White roſe water, of each one ounce, honey two ounces, the Whites of ten new laid eggs, boiled hard; of Mirth, Tutty, and the white Troches of Raſis, of each a drachm, Sarcocol, Frankincence, Aloes, and Ceruſe, of each half a drachm: pouder them that are to be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and mixe them all in a ſtone morter; then put them into a ſmal glaſs body with a head and receiver, and diſtil it in Balneo: This Water is excellent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ulcers in the eys. Theſe three Diſeaſes I thought good to annex to the cure of the inflamation of the eyes, having a dependency thereupon.</p>

               <p>SOmetimes a Cancer groweth up, and is perfected in the eye, of which there is two ſorts, either oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, or ulcerated: The occult is called a Cancerous Tumor, or Cancer of the Eye: The ulcerated is called a cancerous ulcer in the eye: It is known by a blew, leaden colour, and unequal hardneſs, the veins ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning are very full and blew, and the eye, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the whole head is afflicted with a ſtrong and pricking pain. If the Diſeaſe be fixed and perfect, it is incurable, except it be taken away by manual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but if it be taken in the beginning, it may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: you muſt adminiſter convenient Phyſick, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn a ſutable diet. You muſt draw bloud on the ſame ſide: if you finde occaſion, bleed the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoid veins by Leeches, and apply them behind the ears: after the uſe of theſe, or the like revulſions, purge melancholy often, and gently: once or twice a week (if the body be ſtrong enough) purge with the extract of black Hellebore. Theſe remedies will much diminiſh the humours, and decreaſe the pain, after which you muſt uſe Topicks, ſuch as have prepared Tutty, and the white Troches in them, for which have recourſe to the preceding Chapter. The fleſh of young Pigeons or Chickens applyed to the Cancer, hath been found very available.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:115825:62"/>
               <p>The Rupture of the Cornea, is when the Tunicle is ſo divided, that the watry humour, and ſometimes the Uvea cometh forth. The cauſe of both is a Wound, Ulcer, or a great afflux of humours; by which the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea is ſo diſtended, that it cracks, and the humours contained are let out, and ſometimes the Uv a ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out: <hi>Paulus</hi> divideth this Diſeaſe into four kinds; the firſt cometh forth like the head of a Fly, and therefore he calleth it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; The ſecond is when a greater part cometh forth, and is like the ſtone of a Raiſin, and is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The third is, when the Eruption is ſo great, that it ſeemeth like an Apple, and is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The fourth is when the Uvea (being come forth) is hard, and is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The Cure is very difficult alwayes, but for the moſt part it is incurable. After bleeding (if need be) and purging the peccant humours, you muſt uſe aſtringent and glutinating medicines; as the white Troches, and the white of an Egg dropt into the Eye: then make a Cataplaſme to the part, thus: Take the root of <hi>Solomons</hi> Seal four ounces, Quinces pared and fliced two ounces; Red-roſe leaves a handful, Acatia a drachm; Saffron two ſcruples, boil theſe in red wine, and Plantane water (of each a like quantity) as much as is ſufficient to make a Cataplaſme. Afterwards, to make a perfect conſolidation, take an ounce of the Mucilage of Gum Traganth made in Plantain water, the clarified juyce of Plantain, and of the root of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons Seal, of each one ſpoonful: of the white of an egg beaten to clean water, and a womans breaſt-milk, of both a ſpoonful, waſhed Aloes, prepared Tutty, and Sarcocol, of each two ſcruples, Saffron one ſcruple: pouder what is to be poudered, and mix them for a Collyric.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>Of the Diſeaſes of the corners of the Eyes and Eye-lids.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SOmetimes there happeneth a Tumor in the corner of the Eye, at the root of the noſe; if it do not break, it is called Anchylops; if it do break, it is called Aegylops. Sometimes this Tumor cometh without inflamation, and is bred of a thick, flegmatick, ſlimy humour as the Tumors called Atheromata, Steatoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, &amp;c. of which you ſhall have a brief account in the next book.</p>
               <p>When it cometh with inflamation, it is like a Bile, with ſhooting pain, and very red, and it cometh by thin and cholerick bloud flowing thither, and then impoſthumateth; which being open produceth an Ulcer; then it becomes hollow, and is called <hi>Fiſtula Lachrymalis.</hi> The Cure is very difficult, becauſe it is ill applying medicines, the eye being ſo near. If it hath not been of long continuance, and the Orifice to be ſeen externally, it may be cured by medicines: But if it hath continued a year, the Bone is foul, and hard to be cured without burning. If it turns to a Cancer, it is incurable, becauſe medicines will enlarge it, and increaſe pain, and is known by the hardneſs and blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the skin, the extenſion of the veins, and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the pain.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:115825:63"/>
               <p>You muſt open a vein, if nothing hinder, and revel the humours by purging, which you may do by theſe following Pills, <hi>viz.</hi> Cochiae, Arabicae, Aureae, and Lucis Majoris: then you muſt endeavour to ſtop the progreſs by repelling medicines: take the juyce of Night shade, Shepheards purſe, and Knotgraſſe, of each two ounces; Acacia, the flowers of Balauſtines, Bolearmeniack, Gauls, Frankincenſe, and Roch-allum, of each a drachm; boil them well together: then with four ounces of white Wax, and four drachms of Turpentine, make a Cerate, to be applyed to the fore-head: Afterwards endeavour to reſolve the humours: <hi>Amatus Lucitanus</hi> commends this following Cerate: Take of the Powder of Cockle-ſhels two drams, Mirrh, Aloes, and Frankinſence, of each half an ounce: Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocol, Sanguis Draconis, and Ceruſe, of each three drachms: Opopanax diſſolved in Wine, Vinegar, and Bloud-ſtone, of each one drachm and an half, Saffron two ſcruples, Wax and Rozen, of each three ounces: make a Cerate according to art, and apply it to the corner of the Eye and Forehead. If, after all this, it will come to Suppuration, make uſe of ſuch things as will haſten it, leaſt the humours corrode the part: apply a Plaiſter of Diachilon Simplex. If an infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation approach, apply a Cataplaſme made with white bread and milk: If it break not ſuddenly, open it with a Launcet, cleanſe the Ulcer and heal it. But if it prove a Fiſtula, you muſt be the more careful, firſt to cleanſe it thus. Take of Aqua vitae, and Honey of Roſes, of each one ounce, Mirrh two ounces, with Allum and Verdegreece, of each a drachm: boil them together, and make a Liniment: Unguentum, Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiacum, and Apoſtolorum, is of great virtue in this caſe.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:115825:64"/>
               <p>If the bone be foul, it muſt be cured by an actual Cautery: yet <hi>Fabricius Hildanus</hi> ſaith he cured a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrimal Fiſtula with medicines; he applyed Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium, and upon the ſame an Emplaiſter of Gum-Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi, and this he did till he skaled the bone: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with the Tolutan Balſome, a drop upon a little lint, he incarnated, and conſolidated the Fiſtula in a very ſhort time.</p>
               <p>After this Lachrymal Fiſtula, there followeth a conſuming and diminiſhing of the Caruncle in the corner of the Eye, ſometimes it alſo happeneth by a ſharp humour falling down thither, and ſometimes by cleaſing medicines applyed without diſcretion; this Diſeaſe is called Rhyas: there is another Diſeaſe conrrary to this, which is an immoderate growth and increaſe of the fleſh in the corner of the eye: which proceedeth ſometimes for want of orderly drying up of the Ulcer, and ſometimes by a defluxion of bloud to the part, and this is called Enchanthis. For the cute of the firſt, you muſt perform it by Incarnative Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines: Take of Aloes, Borax, Frankincenſe, Dragons Bloud, Cypreſs Nuts, and Mprtles, of each one dragm, the flowers of Pomegranates, Red Roſes, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, of each two ſcruples; theſeeds of Sumach on ſcruple. Let them be boiled in old Canary, and Plantane, and Roſe-water, of each half a pint, to the conſumption of half, and with this Collyrie often waſh the part affected: the other you muſt cure by taking away the ſuperfluous fleſh, with eating medicines, as Burnt Allum, Burnt Vtriol, Unguentum Aegyptiatum, or Apoſtolorum; or you muſt cut it off, and burn it with an Iron: But proceed which way you will, you muſt not forget convenient Evacuations, for fear of a defluxion, and you muſt beware leaſt you take it not
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115825:64"/> away too near, leaſt it turn to Rhyas. There is alſo a defluxion of Rhenm, iſſuing out of du the corners of the Eyes and is called involuntary weeping, and by ſome Epiphora: for the producing of this Diſeaſe there is an indiſpoſition in the part ſending, and the part receiving: the part ſending is the brain, which, being too hot or too cold, attracteth a watery hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and ſendeth it to the inferiour parts. By the weakneſs, thinneſs, thickneſs, of the Caruncle in the corner of the Eye, it is made uncapable to reſiſt ſuch a defluxion, which often happeneth in the three fore-mentioned Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>This defluxion is conveighed ſometimes by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and ſometimes by the internal veins: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the defluxion is hot, and ſometimes cold. If it be conveighed by the external veins, the veins of the Forehead and Temples are diſtended, and the pain is felt without the Skull; if internally, the pain is felt contrarily. If the humour be hot, it cauſeth the more pain; heat, redneſs, and exulceration of the eye-brows follow.</p>
               <p>If this Diſeaſe cometh from an outward cauſe, if it hath not continued long, it may be ſoon cured, but hardly if your Patient be old. If it proceed from a Lachrymal Fiflula, Rhyas, or Echanthis, it hath its cure with thoſe Diſeaſes. You muſt take away the defluxion, and ſtrengthen the part, you muſt evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the humour offending by purging: likewiſe if the body be phlethorick, and nothing prohibite, you may open a vein. You muſt make revulſions of the flowing humours by Cupping, Veſicatories, Bliſters behind the neck, and Iſſues in the arms.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:115825:65"/>
               <p>For derivation, apply Leeches behind the ears, and Maſticatories in the morning: ſtrengthen the head and brain, whether the humour be hot or cold; the Chap. of the Catarrh, and of the coldeſt diſtempers of the brain, will particularly inform you, how to purge, revel, and derive the peccant humours, and ſtrengthen the part affected. Then you muſt apply aſtringent medicines to the Fore head and temples; if the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour flow through the external veins: If it be a cold humour, take of Frankinſence, Tacamabacca, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich, of each two drachms: Terra Sigillata one drachm, Mace pulverized, and Juniper Gum, of each two ſcruples: Turpentine and Wax ſufficient to make a Cerate for the forehead and temples; But if it be a hot and ſharp humour, take of Endive and Knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs, of each one handful; the Root of Solomon's Seal one pound, beat them well in a Stone morter, and with a pint of White-Wine Vinegar, let them boil till half of the Vinegar be conſumed: then take of Bolearmenick, Sanguis Draconis, Pomegranate Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of each two drachms: Frankinſence, Maſtick, and Red-Roſes, of each half a drachm, pouder them, and mix them with the other, and make a Caraplaſme to be applyed as aforeſaid. You muſt likewiſe apply drying and aſtringent medicines to the part affected. Take of prepared Tutty, Egg-ſhels, Aloes, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and Maſtich, of each two ſcruples, Sarcocol, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis Draconis, and Sumach ſeed, of each one ſcruple; Mirrh and Spicknard, of each ſix grains; make them all into fine pouder, and tie them up in a rag, and ſteep it in white Wine, Fenel, Eye-bright, or white Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, and ſqueez it often into the eyes. Theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines preſcribed for an Ophthalmy are good likewiſe in this diſtemper.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:115825:65"/>
               <p>There is another diſeaſe appertaining to the corner of the Eye, it is called by ſome (Pterygium) by other ſome the Haw in the Eye, and by others Unguis, and it is a hard and Nervous Membrane, growing out of the corner of the Eye, covering the white, and in time the Pupilla alſo. Somtimes it is thin and white, and ſomtimes it is red and full of Veins.</p>
               <p>It is cauſed by Ulceration of the Caruncle of the Eye, and is bred by excrements (flowing to the part) as well as blood; hence it cometh to paſſe that vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Haws are bred, according to the ſeeding hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and may be thus diſtinguiſhed; A red Haw comes of pure blood, a Yellow of Choler, a white of Flegme, a dark and black one of Melancholly. It the Eye affected grow leſſe, it is an evill ſigne, and little hopes there is of recovery.</p>
               <p>If you take it whilſt it is new and beginning, it may (with difficulty) be taken off by medicine; but if it be far gon, it muſt be done by Chirurgery, you muſt Evacuate and purge the Antecedent cauſe, as you have heard ſufficiently already in the other Chapters of the diſeaſes of the eyes; and you muſt uſe the ſame Courſe of Dier.</p>
               <p>Then you may make uſe of thoſe Topicks ſpoken of in the Cure of bliſters in the Eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of Cuttle bone in fine powder, and put it upon the Haw;</hi> this I have known, take the Haw from the Eye of an Horſe: if you mix <hi>Tutty</hi> and <hi>Vitriol</hi> to it, it may prove the better.</p>
               <p>I ſhall inſtance one more commended by <hi>Foreſtus. Take of the juyce of Fennel four ounces; the juyce of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landine three ounces, of Rue two ounces, and of Mallows two ounces and an half, Aloes one drachm, Vitriol two

               <p>THe Eare is the Organ of hearing, the moſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſenſe, the agent of underſtanding, the gate, through which ſcience truth and virtue hath its entrance into the ſoul, this member is ſubject to divers diſeaſes, Similary, Organick, and Common, which are known and diſtinguiſhed by their ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes.</p>
               <p>There is firſt deafneſſe or dullneſſe of hearing, which I ſhall joyne, becauſe they differ only in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and are the ſame in cauſes. I ſhall not ſpend my time to ſhew you the difference between deafneſſe and dullneſſe of hearing, only declare the cauſes of both. The firſt is called by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the other is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, both of theſe have their originall from a diſtemper of the braine. The cauſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115825:66"/> lyeth either in the exterior, or interior cavity; the exterior cavity may be obſtructed or ſtopped by Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, Impoſtume, blood, matter, flegme, or the like, which may prove defective to the hearing; but this cauſe cannot make an abſolute deafneſſe, becauſe there is an open way from the interiour eavity to the Pallat, by which the ſound is carryed; as you may obſerve by thoſe that are hard of hearing, for they are ſubject to hold open their mouths, that ſo they may heare the better, and you may prove it by this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Hold a ſtick between your teeth, with which ſtrike the ſtrings of a muſicall inſtrument, Ropping your Eares, and you may heare the ſound as well or better then with your open Eares. The interior Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity is ſomtimes obſtructed by Flegmatick, and Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick humors, and ſomtimes by blood. Somtimes hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors from all parts of the body are ſent to this Cavity as it happeneth ſomtimes in Feavers. Somtimes the Tympany may be relaxed, ſomtimes by exceſſe of moiſt humors, and ſomtimes by ſome violent and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine noiſe, ſomtimes it is ſtretched or dried after ſome violent diſeaſe, accompanied with watching or faſting, ſomtimes it may be broken by a violent moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or corroded by a ſharp humor. Somtimes Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks adminiſtred over much: ſomtimes a cold diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, or cold water got into the Eare, or ſomtimes the inſtruments of hearing hurt by ſome ſtroke or fall or the like, may be the cauſe of this diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Though it be hard to diſtinguiſh all theſe by their proper ſignes, yet you may by Art, and Conjecture come neare it. If the diſtemper comes from a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the brain: either there is an appearance of ſome diſeaſe in the head, as the Head-Ach, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, &amp;c: or ſome of the other ſences are hurt.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115825:67"/> If the externall Cavity of the Eares be obſtructed by excrementitious humors, or ſomthing fallen in, it may be diſcovered by the Eye. If the interior Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be obſtructed by ſome humor: the humor may be known by ſome preſent or preceeding diſeaſe, or by the conſtitution of the body. The looſeneſſe or moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Tympane, may be conjectured by ſome preceding moiſt diſtemper, the dryneſſe of the ſame part, by the dryneſſe of the whole body. The Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane cannot be broken, unleſſe there hath been ſome violent cauſe, which might break it, preceded.</p>
               <p>If deafneſſe be abſolute, and of long continuance, or if the Patient was borne ſo, it is incurable. If it proceed from a ſharp or continuall Fever, the cure of the Fever is the remedy. The Tympane broken, the deafneſſe is incurable. If it increaſe and decreaſe, it proceedeth from a moveable humor, and is curable. If it hath its originall from a diſtemper of the brain, it is eaſier cured, then if it comes from a proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper of the Eare.</p>
               <p>For the Cure, you muſt conſider what humor is the cauſe of the defect, and you muſt purge the body, and particularly the head: you muſt uſe Revulſions, as Cauteries, Veſicatories, Gargariſms, and Maſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories: to be breiſe, theſe and other remedyes effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all againſt this diſtemper, may be ſought out of the Chapter treating of cold diſtempers of the brain. Sulphurous and Bituminous Baths are very profitable eſpecially if the Patient wear a cap made of Spunge; and the water pumped upon his head. It is good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to make fomentations of theſe following hearbs, <hi>viz.</hi>

After which you muſt put ſome Oyle or Liquors proper to the Cure into the Eare, as Oyle of <hi>Bitter Almonds, Castor, Rue,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Chymicall Oyles of Roſemary, Marjarom, Sage, Fennell, Spike, and Cloves,</hi> which are too hot to be uſed alone, but may with good ſucceſſe be mixed with other Oyles and applyed. <hi>Take the water of an Aſh, (that runneth out at the end, the other being in the fire) one ounce: The dripping of a ſilver Eel, (roſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſpit) as much; a fruple of any of the beforenamed Chymicall Oyles, or a drachm of the other;</hi> mix them and drop it into the Eare. Obſerve this generall rule, that you drop nothing cold into the Eare, and that you ſtop the Eare afterwards with Wooll, or Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and a little Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k into it.</p>
               <p>Somtimes the ſenſe of hearing is prejudiced by a preternaturall noiſe in the Eares; the cauſes of which are many, but cheifly a wind or vapour ſent thither from other parts, or bred there.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:115825:68"/>
               <p>It cometh from all parts of the body, when it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth in a Fever, and this (according to <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>) is deadly. Somtimes it cometh from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Liver, Spleen, Midriffe and Womb: witneſſe Vomitings, Hypocondriak, Melancholly, and fits of the Mother, which for the moſt part are attended with a noiſe in the Eares. Somtimes it is cauſed by Flegme, contained in the Eare, for they that are thick of hearing, are ſeddome free from a noiſe in the Head: a blow, great ſound, or an Ulcer in the head may cauſe a noiſe in the head, a hot diſtemper in the head filleth the Arteries of the Eare with much ſpirit, and cauſeth a noiſe. If the noiſe hath been of long continuance, it is hardly Cured: if it proceed from Flegme, Obſtructing the paſſage, 'tis doubtfull that it will end in deafneſſe. If you judge it curable, you may find the cure in this Chapter, for it differeth not in cure from dullneſſe of hearing in ſome Caſes; and agreeth with the cure of the paine of the Eares in others. But this remember, that if it come by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Stomach, Liver, &amp;c: take away the cauſe and the effect ceaſeth.</p>
               <p>Pain in the Eares is called in Greek <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and is cauſed by cold winds, cold baths, or the like, or by a hot diſtemper, ſo it be accompanied with a defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humors, otherwiſe heat is freindly to thoſe Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and Membranous parts.</p>
               <p>The cold matter which cauſeth pain is Flegme, water or cold wind, either coming from without, or from ſome inferiour part within.</p>
               <p>The hot matter is Choler or blood.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:115825:68"/>
               <p>There may be other evident cauſes of pain, as wounds, Contuſions, Ulcers, or breaking of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume, or any hard or pricking thing got into the Eare. You may judge the diſtemper to be from cold, if a cold cauſe hath preceded, and hot medicines profit; the contrary declareth a hot diſtemper; If Flegme cauſe the paine, the Eare and Head will be heavy, ſome Rhume falleth upon ſome other part; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper is taken in cold wether, or the Patient is old. If wind be the cauſe, the paine is without heavineſſe, nor is it conſtant. If water cauſeth the pain, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is troubled with a ſharp defluxion upon the Teeth, Eyes, Breaſt, &amp;c. If it come from Choler; the paine is ſharp and pricking, cold things give eaſe, the body is Cholerick, &amp;c. An inflammation is accompanied with a great heating paine, the parts adjacent are very red, and there is joyned a Fever. A wound maketh it ſelf known by blood iſſuing out at the Eare, and an Ulcer by filth. But ſomtimes there iſſueth filth from an Impoſtume in the braine, but this may be diſtinguiſhed by Head ach preceding, and other ſignes of Impoſtume; the filth cometh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in great abundance at firſt, and decreaſeth by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. If an Ulcer follow an Impoſtume in the Eare, the ſymptomes of an Impoſtume going before declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it. If the Ulcer come by defluxion, there is a burning and ſhooting paine, and the matter iſſueth forth by little and conſtantly. If the Ulcer be in the bone, the matter is thin, and yellow, and hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued long: the deeper the Ulcer is, the more mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter iſſueth; the fouler it is, the more and thicker is the matter: If it be Virulent the matter is thin, if putrid, it ſtinketh much; if it corrode, blood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth the matter; If it continue very long, it
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115825:69"/> groweth Fiſtulous, and then the matter is Virulent and the fleſh groweth hard.</p>
               <p>If the diſtemper proceed from a cold cauſe, with or without matter, you muſt uſe the medicines, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for the cure of deafneſſe, eſpecially fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and fumes, with warme oyles dropt into the Eare, and if it be with matter you muſt evacuate, and purge the humor. If the diſtemper come from a hot cauſe without matter, uſe cooling Topicks. If it hath a Cholerick matter, you muſt revel the humor by Phlebotomy, and with cooling drinks and Juleps al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the preternaturall heat of the Liver, but this having dependancy to the diſeaſes of the head, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding from a hot cauſe; alſo to the inflammation of the Eare, I leave the ingenious there to ſeek the Cure.</p>
               <p>The inflammation of the Eare is cured by making revulſion (after the adminiſtration of an Emollient Cliſter) by blood-letting; and this muſt be done, in as great a quantity as the violentneſſe of the diſeaſe requireth, and the ſtrength, age and conſtitution of the Patient permitteth: open the Head-Vein on the ſame ſide the inflammation is. If the ſtoppage of the Termes hath been prejudiciall, open the Saphaena, or the Hemorrhoids if you ſee occaſion. Revulſions by frictions and ligatures of the Armes and Thighs; Cupping the Shoulders and Back with or without ſcarifications, are often ſucceſſefull; a Cupping-glaſs fixed behind the Eares with Scarification hath been attended with admirable ſucceſſe: and Horſleeches applyed to the ſame place, hath been no leſſe effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:115825:69"/>
               <p>If you find the Cure difficult, the opening of the Arteries in the Temples is good to prevent hot and windy bloud, which doth much feed the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; you muſt often purge Choller, and temper the Humours with cooling Juleps thus: <hi>Take of Lettice, Purflane, and Sorrel Water, of each two ounces; the Water of Plantane and Succory, of each three ounces; of Syrup of Lemons two ounces; the Syrup of Erratick Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies one ounce; mixe them, and make a Julep; take ſour ſpoonſuls morning and evening.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may foment the Ear with the decoction of cooling and piercing Hearbs, and let the Patient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame with a Funnel: then come to the uſe of Topicks, which have power to mitigate pain thus: <hi>Take of Breaſt milk two Ounces, the Oyl of Roſes, and Water-Lillies, of each one ounce and an half: the Water of an Aſhen ſtick before mentioned, one ounce, the White of an Egg beaten to water half an ounce mixe them and drop ſome into the Ear, after you have formented and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you would have it repelling, add Vinegar of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to it, but uſe it with moderation, leſt you drive the Humours to the Brain.</p>
               <p>If the vehemency of the pain conſtrain you to make uſe of ſtupefactive Medicines, mixea ſcruple of Opium, or an ounce of Oyl of Poppy ſeeds, with your former Medicine; but be careful alſo in the uſe of this, leſt you offend the Brain.</p>
               <p>If you ſee occaſion for reſolving Medicines, the Oyls of Camomil, Dill, ſweet Almonds, and Violets; all or either of them may be mixed with your aforeſaid Medicine.</p>
               <p>If after all this you find that the Impoſthume will come to ſuppuration, you muſt help Nature therein
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115825:70"/> thus. <hi>Take the leaves of Mallows, Nightſhade, Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, and Dill, of each one handful: bruiſe them well in a STONE-MORTAR; boil them in a quart of milk to the conſumption of half: add the Muſilage of Line-ſeed, Fleabane, and Fenugreek ſeeds, of each one ounce; Ducks and Hens Greaſe, of each one ounce; the Oyl of Camomel, Roſes, and Violets, of each one ounce; with the crum of White Bread, as much as is ſufficient, make a Cataplaſm, and apply it.</hi> After the Impoſthume is broken, and the Matter run out, you muſt apply cleanſing Medicines, <hi>viz. Mixe Barley water, and Honey of Roſes, and drop it into the Ear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Humour be ſharp, and cauſe an Ulcer, you muſt, after the uſe of needful Purgings, neceſſary blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and all requiſite Evacuations, make uſe of cleanſing and drying Topicks. <hi>Take of the juyce of Reets, and ſow-Bread, of each one ounce; Horehound, Smallage, and Wormwood, of each half an ounce; Myrrh, and Frankincenſe, of each half a drachm; Saffron, and Verdegreece, of each one ſcruple; White Wine, and Honey, of each four Ounces; boil it, and ſcum it, till the Wine be conſumed: then drop of it into the Ear</hi> 2 <hi>or</hi> 3 <hi>times in a day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After you have well cleanſed it, you muſt come to cicatrize it: <hi>Take of the Powder of Galls, and Burnt Allum, of each one drachm; Frankincenſe, and Myrrh, of each half a drachm; Gum of Juniper, and Sarcocol, of each one ſeruple;</hi> make them into fine Powder, and mixe them with White-Wine, and drop it into the Bar.</p>
               <p>If you find that it is ſed by defluxion, you muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to divert the deflaxion, as you are taught in the 9th Chapter of this Book.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:115825:70"/>
               <p>If the Ulcet be very foul, you muſt mixe <hi>Unguentum Aegyptiacum,</hi> and the Ruſt of Iron powdered with White-Wine, and drop it into the Ear. If the Humor be ſharp, and you find ſharp Medicines diſagreeing to it, make uſe of the Oyls, and yelks of Eggs, of ſweet and bitter Almonds.</p>
               <p>If any thing be fallen into the Ear, you muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to get it out with an Ear-picker, but beware leſt you thruſt it further. If you cannot prevail ſo, inject Oyl into the Ear, to relax it, that it may the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier come out, and anoint the Ear-picker with Bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, and ſee if by that means you can draw it out. Provoke ſneeſing, with the Mouth and Noſtrils ſhut, and by that means it may be forced out. If a Flea, being got into the Ear, procure pain and trouble to the Patient, make a little Ball of Dogs hair, and put it into the Ear, and the Flea will come into it. If by ſwimming, or waſhing the Head, Water getteth into the Ear, and is the cauſe of pain, hop on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary foot to that ſide, and hold your Ear downwards, or put in a dry Spunge into the Ear, and as it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moiſt take it out, and put in more till you be freed.</p>

               </head>
               <p>AS God and Nature hath wiſely inſtituted and ordained this Member, as needful and official to the ſervice of the body, ſo the Corruption of Nature (by our Fall) hath brought many Diſtempers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ulcer of the Noſtrils, and Ozaena; Sarco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, and Polypus; the loſs of Smelling in the Noſe, the Coryza, Sneezing, and Bleeding; the laſt of which I ſhall treat of in a Chapter by it ſelf, and ſpeak briefly of the reſt in this Chapter. And firſt of the Ulcer of the Noſtrils; which, whileſt it is new, is called the ſimple Ulcer of the Noſtrils: when it is old, it is called Ozaena. The cauſe of the ſimple Ulcer, is either internal, or external: Internal, when a ſharp or ſalt Humour floweth to the pare: Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, either by a Wound or Contuſion. The cauſe of Ozaena, is a malignant and acrimonious Humour, or the other Ulcer neglected. They are eaſily known and diſtinguiſhed one from the other: The ſimple Ulcer cauſeth but little pain, ſometimes ſends forth bloud, and ſometimes caſteth forth a Scab.</p>
               <p>The Ozaena is more painfuls foul, and ſtinking, anoying not onely the Patient, but all that come near him.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:115825:71"/>
               <p>If it turn to a Cancer, it eateth the Griſtle of the Noſe, and deſtroyeth the Pallat, and for the moſt part hath its original from the <hi>French Pox,</hi> or <hi>Elephantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The New Ulcer may be eaſily cured; the old one hardly. If it turn to a Cancer it is never cured: If it hath its original from the <hi>French Pox,</hi> or <hi>Elephan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaſis,</hi> it cannot be cured, till the Diſeaſe be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>For the Cure, you muſt uſe convenient Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Purging and Bleeding, Revulſions and Deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by Cupping, Veſicatories, or Cauſticks applyed to the hinder parts; and then ſtrengthen the head, and withall appoint a good Diet, which may hinder and aſſwage the ſharpneſs of the Humour. This being done, if the Ulcer be covered with a Scab, you muſt endeavour to take it off gently, and not raſhly, for fear of a Defluxion of Humours; and to that end you muſt mollifie the Scab with Oyl of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, or freſh Butter, and warm Water. Then you muſt cleanſe it, by waſhing it with Barley Water, and if you mix a little Oyl of Roſes with it, it will not be the worſe: then apply Medicines, which are aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, as the Oytment of Tutty, the white Oyntment, more commonly known by the Latine Name, <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum Album,</hi> the Oyl of the yolks of Eggs; the Oyntment of Tobacco is good, being carefully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
               <p>Ozaena muſt be carefully cleanſed; <hi>Take of Smiths water half a pint, Barley water four ounces, the juyce of Plantane and Wormwood, of each two Ounces: boil them together, till half be conſumed, and ſcum it carefully: then put in ſour Ounces of Honey of Roſes, let the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed often ſnuff it up into his Noſtrils wherein the ulcer
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115825:72"/> is.</hi> You may make an Oyntment more powerful for this purpoſe thus: <hi>Take of the juyce of unripe Grapes half an Ounce, the Peels and Flowers of Pomegranates, of each three drachms; of Myrrh, Allum, and Laudanum, of each two drachms; Aloes, Chalcitis, and Frankincenſe, of each one drachm; the Oyl of Roſes, and Myrtles, of each two Ounces, with red Wax as much as ſufficeth, to make an unguent, which apply to the ulcer.</hi> Or you may waſh it with Allum Water; and if it want cleanſing, mixe a little <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> with it.</p>
               <p>The ſublimate Water doth dry and cleanſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully, and you may prepare it thus: <hi>Take of Crude Sublimate in Powder twelve Grains, put it into four Ounces of Plantane water, and boil it to the conſumption of half.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now and then touch it with this water; When it is throughly cleanſed, you muſt prepare Medicines, which are powerful to dry it up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rondeletius</hi> commendeth the ſmoke of a Wax Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle taken up into the Noſe often: or you may make a Fume thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of Labdanum, Benjamin, Hypociſtis, Maſlich, Myrrh, Red Storax, and Calamith, Sandarach, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe Bark, and red Arſenick, of each three drachms, with ſurpentine ſufficient to make Troches, of which let the Patient take the Fume Morning and Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sarcoma and Polypus is a preternatural Tumor, or Excreſcency of Fleſh in the Noſe: The firſt groweth without ſhape, like proud fleſh; but Polypus ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as it were from ſmall Roots, and hangeth down to the lower part of the Noſe, and ſometimes out of the Noſe.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:115825:72"/>
               <p>If it be rooted high, it ſometimes falleth into the paſſage that goeth into the Pallat. It is a ſpungie ſoft fleſh, white, red, or blew, and it is fuller at the full of the Moon, then at the Change.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of both is a groſs Humour coming from the Brain, mixed with bloud.</p>
               <p>The firſt, for the moſt part, is eaſily cured. The ſecond, with more difficulty: The lower it is rooted in the Noſtril, the eaſier may the Cure be effected: If it be ſoft, white, or red, it is more eaſily cured: but if hard and blew, it is dangerous. You muſt preſcribe a dry and attenuating Diet: you muſt purge the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour you ſee abound; you muſt revel, and repel the Humours, and ſtrengthen the Head, as you are taught in the aforegoing Chapters.</p>
               <p>Then you muſt apply ſuch Medicines to the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour as are drying and aſtringent: If it may not be thus cured, it muſt be taken off by a Cauſtick, or by Inciſion.</p>
               <p>But apply the mildeſt Medicines firſt; <hi>Take the Juyce of the three ſorts of Pomegranates; beil it to the thickneſs of Honey; apply it often to the Excreſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then make uſe of this Sublimate Water ſpoken of before in the Ulcer. This following Water is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by <hi>Weckerus. Take of unripe Grapes three pound, Pomegranate Peels and Flowers, and Sumach, of each two pound; macerate them in Vinegar, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil them: then add to the water thus diſtilled, Allum one pound, Vitriol three Ounces: Distil them again, and with this water often touch the Tumor, for it hath a great power to dry and conſume it.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:115825:73"/>
               <p>You may make it ſtronger, if you ſee occaſion, by adding red Arſenick, and Sandarach to it: Mercury precipitate, and applyed with Honey of Roſes, with a Tent, is good. You may make an Ointment thus: <hi>Take of Letharge of Silver one drachm, Ceruſs three drachms, Pomegranate Peels and Allum, of each two drachms, Verdegreeſe, and Orpiment, of each one drachm: powder them, and in good old white wine, boil them to the thickneſs of Honey: put in a little Oyl of Myrrh, and reſerve it in a Leaden Box, and uſe it as the forenamed Medicines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſence of Smelling is either diminiſhed, aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or depraved; either by Obſtruction, or Aſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Cold, moiſt, and Flegmatick Diſtempers, may either dull or aboliſh the ſence of Smelling: Hence Defluxions, upon thoſe parts, do hinder the ſence. Flegm obſtructs and hindereth the ſenſible paſſages, <hi>viz.</hi> the Noſtrils, and the Pores of the Brain, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Paſſages, and the Proceſſus Mamillates; or Sarcoma, and Polypus, may hinder the ſenceby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the Noſtrils. Smelling is hindered by Aſtriction, when Flegm, gathered in the fore-part of the Brain, doth compreſs the Mamillares, as was ſaid before in the compreſſion of the Optick Nerves. Sometimes this Sence is depraved by ſome putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or ulcer in the Noſe, or the Menings, or ſome of the parts official to this Sence, and thereby hindereth it: or ſome ſtinking Vapour ariſing from ſome other part of the Body, may hinder the exerciſe of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: as the Tongue is depraved by Choller, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all things that is taſted ſeem bitter, the ſignes are theſe: Slimy Flegm coming from the Brain, and cold and moiſture oppreſſing the Brain, ſhew Flegm
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115825:73"/> to be the cauſe. If it be from Sarcoma, or Polypus, it is eaſily diſcovered. If the matter cauſing the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction be contained in the Noſtrils, the ſpeech is hurt alſo: but it is not ſo, if it be in the Mamillares, or the fore-part of the Brain. The Cure is diverſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diverſity of cauſes: I ſhall ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it, onely give you this general Rule: If it come from a Defluxion, you muſt proceed, as you are inſtructed, in the cure of a cold Catarrh. If from obſtruction, or compreſſion of the Mamillares, I ſhall refer you to the Chapter, treating of the cold diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Brain, for the Cure.</p>
               <p>In the 9th Chapter of this Book, treating of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion, I told you if it fell into the Noſe, it is a cold Coryza: I think it not amiſs, if I here ſpeak a word or two of the nature and cauſe of it. This Defluxion is cauſed either by overmuch heat, which doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the crude Humours gathered in the fore Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles of the Brain; or elſe by cold, which doth compreſs and ſqueez the aforeſaid Humours. This is eaſily known by the Humours flowing through the Noſe; and of all Catarrhs, it is the moſt eaſie to cure. For the Cure repair to the 9th Chapter: to which add the Vapour of Marjarom, and Red-Roſe Leaves, boiled in Vinegar, taken into the Noſe. It the Diſtemper be cold, <hi>Take Frankincenſe, Maſtich, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gella, and the like, thrown upon a Chafingdiſh of Burning Coals, and do as before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhal now ſpeak a word or two of Neeſing (vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſneezing) which, though it be looked upon but as a ſlight effect, not worth mentioning, hath (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a ſharp Defluxion) proveth not onely trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but dangerous: And hence came the Cuſtom of ſaying, <hi>God bleſs you, God ſave you,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt help,</hi> when
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115825:74"/> a man ſneezeth. Sneezing is a ſwift motion of the Brain, by which the Breath is drawn up unto the Brain, to force out that which doth offend: for Snee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing belongs to the Natural Expulſive Faculty of the Brain, and its Membranes: as it is with the Cough which doth by its natural motion, free the Arteries of the Lungs from Flegm, which obſtructeth them. But the proper cauſe of Sneezing, is a ſharp Humour, which doth provoke the inſide of the Noſtrils, (as 'tis verified, by ſnuffing up ſharp things into the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils) which Humour cometh from the Brain, or ſome inferiour parts: ſometimes the coldneſs of the Air doth act upon, and compreſs the Brain, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a ſharp Humour to fall into the Noſtrils, which provoketh Sternucation. The knowledge of this Diſeaſe is manifeſt: outward cauſes appear, and by the ſigns of the parts affected.</p>
               <p>As to the Prognoſtick, it is naturally and eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without danger, accidentally it may prove hurtful; namely in the beginning of Coryza, it hindereth the concoction of the Humours by its violent motion: ſometimes in Feavers it is violent, and cauſeth blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and is prejudicial to the Patients ſtrength. In the Pluriſie, and all Diſeaſes of the Lungs, it is bad, becauſe it violently pulleth thoſe parts, and cauſeth a greater inflammation. Yet if there be Flegme got into the Griſtles of the Lungs, which a Cough can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get out, then is Sneezing helpful. For the moſt part it is friendly to healthy people, and promiſeth help in Feavers. It is good in Apoplexies, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways welcome to women in travel, or troubled with fits of the Mother.</p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:115825:74"/>
               <p>If Sternutation become Symptomatical, you muſt remove the external cauſe, or internal, from whence it cometh by Evacuations, Derivations, Revulſions, and Diſcuſſions: and if you ſee cauſe you muſt bleed, uſe Frictions, Ligatures, and Cupping. In the mean time, you muſt labour to take away the ſharpneſs which provoketh to Stenutation: Let your Patient ſnuff up warm milk, warm water, or warm water and Butter mingled, the Oyls of Roſes, ſweet Almonds, and Violets, which will afford much comfort to the diſeaſed,</p>

                  </gap>: Blood offending either in quantity or quality is the cauſe of theſe diſtempers. Somtimes externall cauſes concur, as wounds, ſtrokes, falls, vehement exerciſe, drunkenneſſe, long ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Sun. It is alſo either Criticall or ſympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall: Criticall, when nature diſchargeth her ſelf of ſuperfluous blood, ſometimes in health, ſometimes in Fevers, and ſomtimes from an inflammation of the Liver or Spleen. Symptomaticall is, when filthy blood, cauſed by the weakneſſe of the Liver (in a Cronical diſtemper) is let go by reaſon of the debility of the retentive faculty; or (by the ſtrength of the expulſive faculty, expelled, as unprofitable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary. If the blood flowes by reaſon of the vein broken, the blood is thick, and floweth continually; if the vein be only opened, the blood is thinner, and floweth by fits. If the veines be eroded or gnawen aſunder, the Patient hath had a ſalt Catarrh, or Ulcer or Cacochymia. The cauſes are eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115825:75"/> by their ſignes, <hi>viz:</hi> A red face and eyes with heavineſſe ſignifieth plenty of blood If choler or Melancholly be the cauſe, the blood is corrupt, and their proper ſignes appeare in the body. If the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the retentive faculty let it go, the body is weak, the face is pale, or ſome diſeaſe hath preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which hath weakened the Liver. If it cometh from an Artery, it cometh with great force, hot, pure and freſh; if from a vein that contrary appeareth. If it come from the Liver, Spleen, &amp;c: pains, extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or inflammations in thoſe parts will declare it. If blood iſſue out of the Noſe upon a judiciall or cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall day, it is a good ſigne, and is not to be ſtopped, if it flow not immoderately. But if it happen in the beginning of a diſeaſe, it is ſymptomaticall and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. If the Liver be affected, and the blood iſſue out at the right Noſtrill it is good, and if the Spleen be affected, if the left Noſtrill bleed it is good; the contrary to any of theſe happening, is bad. If the Haemorrhagy continue long, it cooleth the Liver, and cauſeth a Dropſy: Likewiſe bleeding is very hurtfull to Melancholly and Flegmatick people; as alſo to ſuch as have a quartane Feaver.</p>
               <p>For the Cure, you muſt conſider whether the Haemorrhagy be Criticall or Symptomaticall: If it be Symptomoticall, you muſt endeavour ſuddenly to ſtop it: I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it be Criticall, immoderate, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution not able to endure it without prejudice, you muſt do the like: you muſt begin with revulſions, of which blood letting is the cheiſe; you muſt open a veine on the Arme, on the ſame ſide the Noſtrill is that bleedeth; you may draw as much blood as the ſtrength of the Patiens will beare. Apply Cupping-glaſſes
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115825:76"/> behind to the Shoulders and Armes, to the <hi>Hypocondria:</hi> but make uſe of this, after ſufficient blood letting, for feare of an inflammation of the Liver. <hi>Forreſtus</hi> commendeth the application of Cupping-glaſſes to the feet, others commend an actuall Cautery. Throw cold water into the face on a ſudden, which doth repell the blood. It is good to put a Cloath dipt in Vinegar to the neck be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, another to the Cods, and to ſnuffe up Vinegar and water into the Noſe, and hold the mouth full of it, as long as any thing is ſnuffed up: take up the fume of Vinegar thrown upon an hot Iron. Foment the Forehead and Temples with water and Vinegar cold: Vinegar put into the Eare on the ſame ſide, on which the bleeding Noſtrill is, is good. Then apply a Cataplaſm, made with the juice of Plantane, Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhade, Vinegar, of all a like quantity, and Bolearme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick ſufficient to make a Cataplaſme, which muſt be laid to the forehead, from Temple to Temple. Or thus, <hi>Take of Sanguis Draconis, Terra Sigillata, and Bolearmenick, of each a drachm, Roſe Vinegar, and the juyce of Nightſhade, of each one ounce, the Whites of two Eggs, with the diſtilled water of Red-Roſes, and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, make a Cataplaſm;</hi> and apply it as before. If you perceive that the veins of your forehead are ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, bind a ſix-pence, or a dry bean ſlit, upon the root of the Noſe between the Eye-brows. Alſo the powder of Hoggs-dung blown into the Noſe, or mixed with the juyce of Nettles, and a Tent dipped in it, and put up into the Noſe, hath an excellent property to ſtop bleeding.</p>
               <p>Others commend the Powder of a dried Toad, put in fine red Sarſnet, and put under the Arme-pits, or held in the hand.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:115825:76"/>
               <p>It is convenient likewiſe to make uſe of thoſe things, which have a faculty to cloſe and glutinate the Veins, <hi>Take of Bolearmenick, Sanguis Draconis, Aloes, and Cobwebs, of each two ſcruples, white Vitriol, burnt Egſhels and Paper, of each one ſcruple,</hi> powder them finely, and blow it up into the Noſtrills: to prevent its coming into the mouth, hold the mouth full of cold water, and Vinegar; or elſe you may mix it with the whites of Eggs beaten to water, and the juyce of Plantane, and dip a Tent in it and apply it. If hitherto you are ſucceſleſſe, you muſt make uſe of Eſcharotick medicines, of which burnt Vitriol claimes the preheminency, powdered and uſed as before: but if you feare to uſe it alone, adde the ſame quantity of <hi>Dragons blood, Bolearmenick, and Frankincenſe.</hi> A dram of the powder of Spicknard drunk in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in broth is very good. If the diſeaſe doth often invade the Patient, let him make uſe of inward me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which have power to Coagulate, thicken, coole, bind, and reſtraine its motion: <hi>Take of dried Knotgraſſe, Fumitory, and Bistort root, of each half an ounce; the Troches of Spodium, and Amber, Terra Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillata, and Sal-prunella, of each half a dracbm; Corall, burnt Harts-horne, and Bloudſtone, of each one ſcruple, powder them; Conſerve of Roſes, and Quinces, of each two ounces, with the ſyrrup of the juyce of Plantane, make an Opiate,</hi> of which let the Patient take the quantity of a Nutmeg, five or ſix times in a day. To conclude, if it be inveterate let the peccant humor be diligently evacuated; and if it hath its originall from the diſaffection of any other part, as the Liver Spleen, Womb, Kidneys, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> let that be conſidered and their Cures ſought in their proper Chapters.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe Tongue being the cheife inſtrument of ſpeech and taſt, a very neceſſary (though unruly) member, it is not amiſſe if we conſider, and breifly treat of the diſtempers incident to it, by which the actions are hindered. This member is ſubject to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, and Tumors, which have their originall either from pure, Cholerick, Flegmatick, or Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly blood. If pure blood cauſe the inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is paine felt with heat and redneſſe of the Tongue, and face: and this is a true Flegmon. If the Tumor hath its originall from Choller, then is it called Eriſipelas; if from Flegme, Oedema; if from Melancholly Schirrhus, all which may be diſcovered by the humor predominate, and ſhall be more plainly diſcovered in the next Book, where I ſhall treat of Tumors and their kinds. Theſe Tumors are ſomtimes only troubleſome, but do not oftentimes endanger life, except they grow ſo big, that the body is endangered by ſuffocation; or a malignant melancholly humor, do breed a Cancer, which may be diſcovered by its hardneſſe, blewneſſe, and pricking paine: you muſt begin the Cure with blood-letting, and (if you can come at it) open the Veine under the Tongue, afterwards if you ſee occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, open a Vein in the Arme, and draw away as
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115825:77"/> much blood, as the Patients ſtrength will permitt. You muſt purge the humer with convenient purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, or adminiſter a ſharp Cliſter: Some do draw back the humors by Cupping-glaſſes faſtened to the ſhoulders, or a little one under the Chin. Cooling and repelling Gargariſms muſt be uſed, and you may prepare them thus. <hi>Take of the distilled water or decoction of Plantane, Nightſhade, and Sorrell, of each four ounces; the ſyrrups of Mulberys, Pomegranats, and Lemons, of each one ounce;</hi> let the Patient often waſh his Tongue; <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> commendeth the application of Horſleeches to the Tongue. If you find it inclinable to ſuppuration, you muſt help nature, for which purpoſe this Gargariſm is good. <hi>Take Violet-leaves, Mallows, and Parſly, of each one handfull, whole Barley four ounces; Figs, and Raiſons, stoned, of each three ounces; the ſeed of Flax, and Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek, of each one ounce: Spring water a quart, boyle it to the Conſumption of halfe, ſtraine it, and add four ounces of the ſyrrup of Jujubes; uſe it as the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> When the humors are ſuppurate, if it break not, make inciſion, then cleanſe it with Plantane water and Hony of Roſes</p>
               <p>There is another Tumor under the Tongue, called by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, by the Latines <hi>Ranula,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it repreſenteth the hinder part of a Frog, alſo becauſe they that are thus affected, when they ſpeak do Croake like a Frog. This humor is a looſe and ſoft carnoſity under the Tongue, the tumor therein contained is ſomtimes hot, though for the moſt part it is cold, ſlimy, and pituitous matter, which when it is opened, is like the white of an Egge, ſomtimes mixed with yellow. This diſeaſe is not (for the moſt part) accounted dangerous, unleſſe it be in a Child,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115825:78"/> or the humor be Cancrous. If nothing prohibite, you muſt begin the Cure with blood-letting, that ſo the humors may be the more obedient: you muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe purge the peccant humors with diſcretion: then you may endeavour to diſolve and diſcuſſe the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, thus, <hi>Take of green Mugwort, and Hyſop, of each one handfull, Common Salt, and Salt Armoniack, of each two drachms: Galls one drachm, beat them well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, rub the place often with it.</hi> But if it ſubmit not to this way of Cure, (as it ſeldom doth) you muſt open it with a large Orifice, and if you open it on both ſides, it will be the better: Some commend a Cautery of iron; after you have opened it, ſqueez out the matter with your finger, then waſh it with White-Wine, and Hony of Roſes: or thus, <hi>Take of White Wine, and Plantane water, of each two ounces; diſſolve a drachm of Allum, then add twenty drops of the Oyle of Sulphur, with an ounce of ſyrrup of Mulberrys; make a Lotion, and waſh the place till it be whole.</hi> Somtimes the Tongue ſuffereth a Palſie, by which it is deprived of its motion: Somtimes it followeth an Apoplexy, and ſomtimes it is joyned with a Palſey, which afflicts half the body, ſomtimes it is only in the Tongue, when its nerves and moving Muſcles are prejudiced by ſome moiſt or pituitous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Somtimes thoſe Nerves may be cut, and the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie may follow; <hi>Avicen</hi> confirmeth this opinion, by an example in his time, of a certaine man being cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and ſcarified, by which the ſmall Nerve was cut, and cauſed a relaxation of the Tongue.</p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:115825:78"/>
               <p>If this Palſie follow an Apoplexy, and the other parts of the body be affected, and the Patient be old, it is incurable.</p>
               <p>If you have hopes of recovery, you muſt take away the Antecedent cauſe, lodged in the braine; and you muſt diſſolve and diſcuſſe the conjunct cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the humors which obſtruct the Nerves, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the motion of the Tongue.</p>
               <p>If you ſee occaſion, you may make uſe of Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; it profiteth much to open a Vein under the Tongue: you may purge with Pills, or Cephalick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pozems, you may rarifie the humors by ſweating drinks; cuppings, veſicatoryes, Cauteryes may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: for diſcuſſing and drawing forth of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, let Gargariſms, Maſticatories, and Errhies be followed, for ſtrengthening the braine, and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing offending humors therein contained; make uſe of Fumigations, Powders, and Quilts for the head; for the making and application of which, I refer you to the ſecond Chapter of this Book.</p>

               <p>Every cauſe is known by its proper ſign; for if a hot Humour falling upon the part be the cauſe, the pain is more violent, the Patient is ſenſible of heat, about the Teeth and Gums; hot Medicines encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoth pain.</p>

               <p>If the Tooth-ache come from a hot cauſe, boil the Leaves of Henbane, ſpotted Arſmart, Houſleek, and Nettle Roots, in Vinegar, and waſh the Teeth; and to aſſwage pain, anoint the Checks with the Oyl of Lillies, Roſes, ſweet Almonds: Or you may make a Cataplaſm, with Barley and Bean Meal, the juyce of Houſleek, and Milk, and the aforeſaid Oyls; and if you add a ſmall quantity of Opium to it, it will not be amiſs.</p>
               <p>But take this Caution, that if the Checks be ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, beware how you apply Cataplaſms, leſt the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours be repelled, and do fall into the Throat.</p>
               <p>Many find eaſe by Maſticatories, by which they draw much Rheum from the Teeth; Take of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich, and Pellitory of Spain, of each a drachm; the Seed of Henbane, Satueſacre, and Pepper, of each half a drachm: Pouder them, and ſew them up in Linnen bags, like little Balls, and chew them.</p>
               <p>If the Teeth be hollow, the Oyls of Cloves, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire, Tobacco, Box, and of Hazel Nuts, are good, if a little Lint, dipt in any of them, be put into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Tooth.</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:115825:80"/>
               <p>If the pain ceaſe not, add Laudanum, and Opium; for ſometimes Narcoticks, by ſtupefaction, do give eaſe, when other means have failed. Sometimes all Medicines can do no good, till the Nerve in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Tooth be burned with an actual Cautery. This may be done with Aqua Fortis, or ſafer with Oyl of Vitriol; but be well adviſed, before you operate with things of this Nature.</p>
               <p>If Worms be in the Hollow Tooth, <hi>Take of Aloes two ſcruples, Camphire one ſcruple, Aqua Vitae one ſcruple, the Oyl of Vitriol, and Tobacco, of each three drops; mix them, and with Lint dipped in it, apply it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If all the Medicines preſcribed take not away the pain of the Hollow Teeth you muſt draw it out; but beware of drawing Teeth, when the Defluxion is great, the Head aketh, or the Gums ſwell: Draw not a Tooth violently, leſt you injure the Jaw bone, or cauſe a Flux of bloud, which may prove dangerous; but if ſuch a thing ſhould happen, and the bloud not eaſie to be ſtanched, you muſt apply Burnt Vitriol to the Gum, and dip Lint in Vinegar, and lay thereon; or if you ſee cauſe, you muſt burn the Nerve with an actual Cautery.</p>
               <p>Many people have their Teeth disfigured, by black or yellow Humours cleaving to them, which in time make them rotten: this is cauſed ſometimes by a Defluxion of Humours into the Teeth, by Diſtempers of the Stomach, and evil nouriſhment thence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing:</p>

               <p>Sometimes the Scurvey is the cauſe: For the cure it is requifite, that the antecedent cauſe be removed, by purging and other Remedies; and that things, that corrupt the Teeth be abſtained from, eſpecially things that are ſweet. Many are the Medicines preſcribed to make the ſeeth white; as Corral, White and Red, poudered, Tobacco Aſhes, and the Aſhes of Vine Branche, burnt, Burnt Allum, and many more: that which I have found to be the moſt excellent, is the Oyl of Vitaiol, mixed with Spring Water, and the Teeth waſhed therewith: ſome ſay the Oyl of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur hath the ſame virtue.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ANgina, or the Quinzie is a diſeaſe of the Jaws and Throat, by which breathing and Swallowing are hindred, withour defect of the breaſt and Lungs: there are two ſorts of Quinzyes, Legitimate and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard: Legitimate Quinzy is accompanied with a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and inflammation of the part; which <hi>Galen,</hi> and the antient Greekes, have divided into four ſorts: the firſt they called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> when the inflammation is in the inward &amp; proper Muſcles of the Larynx: the ſecond they called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp; the outward Muſcles of the Larynx are in flammed: the third, they called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the interiour muſcles of the pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynx are inflamed: the laſt they called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> becauſe the exerior muſcels of the Jaws are inflamed; a Baſtard Angina or Quinzy cometh without a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of the firſt, is blood either pure or mixed with Choler, flegm, or melancholly; flowing from the head to the jugular veins: the cauſe of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Angina is cauſed by much flegme falling into the jugular veins, and by its glewineſſe obſtructing the paſſage of the ſpirits; or by a Tumor in the Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae of the neck, cauſed by a deflux of cold flegm removing the Vertebrae from its proper ſeat or cauſing a luxation thereof, by looſening their Nerves, and making them ſlippery between the joynts: or laſtly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115825:85"/> this may happen by ſome fall or ſtroak or ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſe.</p>
               <p>The Legitimate Quinzy may be known by the difficult ſwallowing and breathing, without fault of the breaſt or Lungs; pain about the Jaws and threat, red neſſe heat and a feaver: their ſorts may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by their proper ſignes. In the firſt, there is great hinderance of reſpiration, the patient is almoſt ſtrangled, cannot breathe except he open his mouth and hold his neck ſtreight. In the ſecond, there is leſſe difficulty of breathing but greater of ſwallowing, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of drink which flyeth out at the noſe. In the third, there is ſome red tumor about the Jaws, leſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiulty of brething, then in the firſt, but more then in the ſecond. The laſt doth hinder the breath but little, or not at all, the outward parts of the neck are red and painfull.</p>
               <p>The baſtard <hi>Angina</hi> may be known by the abundance of flegm, and humors flowing to the mouth: If it comes by Luxation, the motion of the head and neck is hurt, and a preternatural cavity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the neck: I ſhall not need, to ſpend time, to ſhew the ſignes of every diſtinct humor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominating: reaſon, or other parts of this book will informe you.</p>
               <p>A Legitimate Quinzy is an acute diſeaſe, and very dangerous, for want of freedome in reſpiration; therefore the firſt is worſt, and the patient in moſt danger of ſtrangling: the other are more or leſſe dangerous as they more or leſſe hinder reſpiration. If the matter fall upon the Lungs, or the ſwelling va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh away, without critical or artificial Evacuation, it is very dangerous, and for the moſt part deadly. If the patient foame at the mouth, it is a ſigne of death ſaith <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his 43 Aphoriſm, becauſe it is a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115825:85"/> ſigne of ſtreightneſſe and violent heat about the heart, which ſqueezeth the moiſture out of the Lungs, and ſendeth it to the mouth in a foame.</p>
               <p>Every Quinzy requireth a haſty and ſpeedy cure, for it ſometimes killeth in one day: read <hi>Fernelius Lib:</hi> 5 <hi>pag.</hi> 284. Let the phyſitian open the Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Vein, and, if the body be naturally plethorick, and blood the cauſe of the diſeaſe, draw as much as the Patients ſtrength will bear, and reiterate Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, according as neceſſity requireth: give a Gliſter firſt, or after, or both, or as often as need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth; you muſt ſpeedily make uſe of other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, as cupping glaſſes with ſcarification to the ſhoulders, veſicatories, frictions, and ligatures to the lower parts; purges muſt be adminiſtred, and if you find the caſe deſperate, you need not Queſtion the time of the day: <hi>Trallianus</hi> reporteth that he was forced to open a Vein, and to purge the ſame day, or elſe his Patient had bin ſtrangled. To derive the humor from the part, it is good to open the Veins under the tongue, called Ranulae. If the eaſe be deſperate, open the jugular Vein, and if the blood cannot be ſtopped, make uſe of <hi>Galens</hi> Emplaiſter, againſt a flux of blood. You muſt make uſe of Gargariſms, which have power to allay the inflammation, &amp; ſomewhat to repel. <hi>Take the leaves of Plantaine, Nightſhade, Woodbine, Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry, and Cinqueoil, of each one handful: the flowers of red roſes, and pomegranates, of each one pugill: boile them in a quart of running water to a pint, Strain it and adde four ounces of Sirrup of Mulberies.</hi> But beware leſt repelling medicines drive the matter to the Lungs. The oyle of Vitriol mixed with water, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to allay its ſharpneſſe, often taken, is good to allay the inflammation of the ſtomack, Liver, and veins, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the parts inflamed in this diſtemper. Then you muſt
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115825:86"/> apply looſning and reſolving Liniments, adding ſuch things as eaſeth pain. <hi>Take of the juice of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Chamomel, and Orpine, of each two ounces, the oyle of Chamomel, ſweet Almonds, and Lillies, of each one ounce: hens greaſe and friſh Buter, of each three ounces, boile it to the Conſumption of the juices and make a Liniment.</hi> You muſt apply ſuch things as have power to diſſolve, among thoſe which have a peculiar property againſt the Quinzy, as <hi>Riverius</hi> teacheth: <hi>Take of a Swallows neſt and Album graecum of each one drachm, powder them: flowerdeluce roots, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momel, of each halfe a drachm: Hens greaſe and oyle of Lillys of each one ounce, yellow wax a little, make a Liniment.</hi> Orpine hath a peculiar faculty againſt the Quinzy, if the bruiſed hearb be outwardly applyed, and the juice ſweetned with hony often ſwallowed. Let us not forget the old and vulgar medicine viz. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum graecum and hony mixed, and adminiſtred like a Lohock. For ſqeemiſh ſtomacks, or ſuch as delight in dearer medicines, you may prepare this lohock; <hi>Take of Species Diatraganthum frigidum, and diapenidion, of each one ounce: Lohock Epinis, et Sanum et Exper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, of each halfe an ounce: mix them, and with the Sirrups of Mulberies and Jujubes ſufficient, make a</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hock, and take as before. If it tend to Suppuration, make uſe of the firſt Liniment, preſcribed in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Caſſia newly drawn held in the mouth and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwallowed, eaſeth pain, and maturateth the humors: when it is ripe and will not eaſily break, you muſt open it with a crooked inciſion-knife: or drop a little oyle of Vitriol upon it, when it is open, let the Patient hold down his head, that the matter may run forth; then waſh it often with barly water, and hony of roſes.</p>

This diſeaſe is cauſed for the moſt part from flegm, which falleth from the head into the Lungs, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth the wind-pipe: ſometimes humors brought thither by Arteria Venoſa, flow to the Bronchia, and cauſeth Aſthma with ſnorting: but if they fall into the ſubſtance themſelves, or into the ſmooth arteries, it cauſeth an Aſthma without ſnothing. There needeth
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115825:87"/> no more ſignes for the diſcovery of this diſeaſe, then what may be gathered from its deſcription. As to the prognoſtick, I ſay; that this diſeaſe is Chronical &amp; hard to be cured, unleſſe the Patient be young and of a ſtrong Conſtitution: if a child hath this diſeaſe, if it be not ſpeedily removed, it dieth of a Catarth. In men, it ends in Chachexia or the dropſy. If it turne to a pleuriſy, or peripneumonia, it is deadly.</p>
               <p>You may begin the cure with blood-letting if the body be plethorick or Corpulent, for when the Veins are empty of blood the reſpiration is free. But you muſt beware of phlebotomy in ſuch bodies, where you fear diminiſhing the natural heat, leſt flegme increaſe. You may openthe Saphaena, or ancle-Vein without danger; you muſt, in the next place, purge the head of Phlegmatick humors, which are preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the ſecond Chapter of this Book. It oftentimes hath bin proved that vomitting is good in this caſe, that the ſtomack may be emptied of flegm and thick vapors, which puffing up the ſtomack compreſſeth the diaphragma, and cauſeth difficulty of breathing: one ounce of Tobacco water, ſweetened with Sugar, will cleanſe the ſtomack by vomit. Let the Phyſitian be careful how he adminiſtreth vomits to weak people. Sharp Gliſters are good in this diſeaſe, for revulſion; but let them be given in ſmall quantityes, leſt the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Bowels, compreſſe the diaphragma. The Patient muſt make uſe of ſuch things as extenuate, and make thin the humors, <hi>Take of Coltsfoot-water two ounces, Cinamon water one ounce: with an ounce of Oximel Simplex, and take it in the morning.</hi> Then let him make uſe of ſuch as have an Expectorating quality: <hi>Take of the powder Diatraganthum Frigidum, the powder of Liquoriſh, and Colts ſoot; of each one drachm; the roots of Elecampane, and Marſh mallows
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115825:87"/> Candied, Conſerve of roſes and Violets of each halfe a drachm, the flower of Brimstone, and Sugar Candy, of each a ſcruple, with oyle of ſweet Almonds, (newly drawn) and Sirrup of Maidenhaire; make a Lohock.</hi> And let the Patient take the quantity of a Nutmeg, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening; and halfe ſo much every two houres: this I have often given with good ſucceſſe. In the extremity of the Fit rub the breaſt with a cloath to open the pores, &amp; then anoint it with this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ointment. <hi>Take of the Oyle of Chamomel, Dill, Rew, and ſweet Almonds of each two drachms; the Roots of Elecampane, and Flowerdeluce in powder, of each one drachm: the meale of flax-ſeed and Fenugreek a drachm; Saffron one ſcruple with wax ſufficient; make an oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Out of the fit, to perfect the cure, you muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſtop the defluxion, and to cleanſe the Lungs. For the firſt you may find ſefficient remedies, in the ninth Chapter of this book, adding ſuch which reſpect the breaſt, to them: Let your medicines not be too drying, leſt they thicken the humors and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the diſeaſe. Then you muſt endeavor to unſtuffe and cleanſe the Lungs and wind pipe, with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named Lohock, or of the like nature. I could inſert many which I omit for brevitie ſake. <hi>Querceta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his Sirrup of Tobacco is very good: the Tincture of dryed Tobacco, as much as a peaſe held in the mouth, and ſwallowed by degrees, draweth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of flegm out of the ſtomack and Lungs: or if you take Tobacco in a pipe, it is good. The juice of red Coleworts made up into a Sirrup and a little Spirit of Sulphur added to it, may be taken, an ounce in the Morning. Or you may make Tablets of great virtue thus: <hi rend="margQuotes">Take of the Roots of Elecampane and Lico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, of each one ounce: the Leaves of Colts foot, Maiden haire, Scabius, and Woodbetony, of each a drachm: Lac

The ſignes of a Pleuriſie (according to <hi>Galen</hi>) are five: firſt a pricking pain of the ſide; cauſed by a Cholerick humor in the Membrane, extending it ſelf, either towards the throat, or the Hypochondria. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly a continual ſharp Feaver, which is either Symptomatical, comming from ſome Sangnineous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor about the part; or eſſential, that is, when a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver firſt invadeth the Patient, and the boiling blood is expelled to thoſe parts.

Fourthly, a hard Pulſe like a Saw; which is cauſed by the ſtretching out of the Membrane, by which defect the Arteries
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115825:89"/> are diſtended. Fifthly and laſtly, an often and troubleſome Cough; becauſe nature doth ſtrive to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel thoſe troubleſome humors from the part affected; alſo ſome of the matter ſweateth from thence into the Lungs, which cauſeth a Cough. I might here add another ſigne <hi>viz.</hi> ſpitting of blood or bloody matter, but becauſe it happeneth not in all Pleuriſies, nor at all times, I omit it. You may partly judge of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor peceant by the conſtitution of the Patient, and ſeaſon of the Year. The particular ſignes are firſt of blood, bloody ſpittle, ſtretching and pricking pains, full Veins eſpecially about the Temples, red Urine, and the like. Signes of Choler are, yellow ſpittle, a burning Feaver, a hard and quick pulſe, the pain more acute and pricking, reſtleſneſſe, bitterneſſe of the mouth, and yellow Urine. The ſignes that ſhew Phlegm, are, much, ſweet, and frothy Spittle, the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver remiſs, little thirſt, the pain heavy but not violent, the pulſe not ſo hard, the Urine white and thick, the Spittle black and tough, the pain and Feaver moderate, a dry Cough, the tongue black and rough; the belly bound, the Urine red and darke, are ſignes of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly. As to the prognoſtick I ſay. This diſeaſe afflicting old men, women with child, Aſthmatical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or ſuch as have had it often, is dangerous. If the Feaver be violent, the breath fetched with diſſiculty, the Cough raiſeth up no matter; or the Spittle very bloody, or very white, and glutinating, green, tuſtick black; much Spitting and yet the pain abates not; the ſpitting ceaſe and the pain continue; all theſe are dangerous ſignes. On the contrary plentiful vomitting, Choler in the beginning of the diſeaſe; blood or Choler mixed with the ſpittle &amp;c. are good ſignes.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of a Pleuriſie, conſiſts in the revelling,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115825:89"/> Deriving, diſcuſſing, digeſting, maturating, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectorating the peccant humors: if the Feaver be eſſential, ſeek its cure in its proper place. Bleeding is a very natural remedy for a Pleuriſie, which you muſt moderate, according to the conſtitution and ſtrength of your Patient; and the violent or remiſs, ſymptoms. If your Patient ſpitt freely, forbeare blood-letting, leſt his ſpitting be ſtayed, and his life endangered. Twice or thrice in a day, or oftener, as you ſee occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, adminiſter cooling Juleps, to reſtrain the heat of the boiling humors: make a Iulep of Poppy water and Sirrup of Violets.

If his Cough be violent let him alwayes have in his mouth, Sugar of Roſes, Sugar Candy or penids, or the Tablets of Diatraganthum Frigidum, or with Sirrup of Violets and Jujubes you may make it into the form of an Celegma or Lohock. If his ſpittle be thick and tough, adde Oxymel Simplex, or the Sirrups of Liquoris, or Coltsfoot. Let his conſtant drink be Barly water, boile it in Currans, Borrage and Bugloſs Flowers, Hartshorne, Maidenhaire, Coltsfoot, Liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris and ſuch like, give it warm. You muſt not purge in this diſeaſe, till the declination thereof, and then uſe a gentle potion. Many medicines there are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ſpecial for a Pleuriſie: as Stone-horſe dung, or White-hens dung, ſoaked in Carduus water, and ſtrained, give a quarter of a pint; this hath a peircing and diſcuſſing quality, (by reaſon of the volatile ſalt in it) and doth wonderfully diſperſe the humors in the Pleuriſie. An Apple, made hollow, and a dram of Frankincenſe put therein and roſted, given to the ſick, drinking three ounces of Carduus Water after it and laid to ſweat, is good, ſaith <hi>Quercetan.</hi> Goats Blood alſo is good. If the Sick fall into a looſneſs in the height of this Diſeaſe, it is very dangerous: in the declination it is good: but if it ſo happen, give him the Sirrup of Myrtles; and do as you are taught in the Cure of Diarrhaea.</p>

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times blood falling into the Thorax, by the breaking or wounding of a Vein, may come to Suppuration, or rather Corruption. Sometimes, flegm falleth from the head and other parts into the breaſt, and there putrifying, begetteth matter like quitter.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly the ſharpneſs of the matter touching the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115825:91"/> Membranes, cauſeth quaking; the Third, is weight and ſenſe of heavineſs in the part. To theſe we may adde the difficulty of breathing; for although when the Impoſthume is broken, the Diaphragma, and the Muſcles of the Thorax, move more freely; yet the Lungs are oppreſſed by the matter lying, about them. But an old and confirmed Empyema is known, by a lingring, putrid and partly Hectick Feaver, more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent towards night, and much ſweating, a conſtant troubleſome Cough; the Cheeks grow Red, the Eyes hollow, the legs ſwell, Puſtles break out on the breaſt. If the Suppuration break, and the Feaver continueth, are thirſty, want appetite, the <hi>pus</hi> green, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid or frothy, brought up with much difficulty, and a looſe belly; all theſe are ſignes of Death, or of long ſickneſs: the contrary are the ſignes of recovery.

               <p>If the matter be not ſpit forth in forty dayes, it turneth to a Conſumption and death followeth. The Supuration on both ſides is more dangerous then that of one: that on the left ſide the worſt, by reaſon of the left Ventricle of the heart. If the matter flow plentifully by Stoole and Urine, and the Patient ſtrong and hearty, it is a ſigne of recovery.</p>
               <p>For the Cure: you muſt endeavour to help nature in Suppurating the humors, if Suppuration cannot be hindred, by this or the like Cataplaſme: <hi rend="margQuotes">Take of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momel, Melilot, and Mallows, of each one handful; the Roors of Althaea; one handful: Figs, and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſtoned, of each four ounces: after due boiling, beat, and ſtrain them, adding to the Liquor, the Oyles of ſweet Almonds, Lilies, and Freſh Butter,

It is very difficult to judge of the part from whence it commeth. If it comes from the head, it is caſt forth by Coughing, hawking, and there is a tickling in the Palat, as in a Catarrh. That which comes from the breaſt and Lungs, cauſeth Coughing: that which comes from the Lungs is Frothy; that which comes from the breaſt is Blackiſh, and commeth up with pain. That which comes from the Gullet and Stomack, is known by Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting; from the Jaws and Wezand, by Hawking; from the Mouth, by ſimple ſpetting. Sometimes the Blood is ſent from ſome other part to the Lungs and ſpet forth: but this may be known by pain, or ſome hurt happened there.

               <p>You muſt begin the cure with Blood-letting; open a Vein on the ſame ſide, you judge the diſtemper to be.

               </head>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is called in Latine <hi>Tabes,</hi> and in Greek <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which although it ſignifieth every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, yet is moſt properly taken for the extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole Body, cauſed by an Ulcer in the Lungs. An Ulcer in the Lungs, by reaſon of its nearneſſe to the heart, afflicts it with putrid vapours; the heart diſperſeth it into all parts; hence commeth a Feaver hectick joyned with a putrid; and by its unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, does hinder the well concocting of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hence the whole Body decayeth. Sometimes ſharp corroding and Salt humors falling from the head, or the Suppurated humors from the Pleuriſie, or Empyema, which humors putrifying upon the Lungs may Ulcerate them. Many times the cauſe is in the Lungs themſelves, which have a vitious, hereditary conſtitution naturally tender, and diſpoſed to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Sometimes a Puſtule is bred in the Lungs, and never breaketh, but groweth till it ſtop the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the breath, and killeth the Patient. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it commeth to Suppuration and is called the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume of the Lungs: which being broken, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Bronchia, or paſſages in the Lungs, it may be ſpit up, if the body be ſtrong and the matter little in quantity: but many times an Ulcer remaineth, which cauſeth a Conſumption. If the Impoſtumated
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115825:94"/> matter flow into the Ventricle of the heart, the ſick dye ſudainly; and many times inſenſible of any pain or ſickneſſe: take examples from <hi>Fernelius lib.</hi> 5. de <hi>partium morbis et Sympt. Chapter.</hi> 10: <hi>Pag.</hi> 288. To the cauſes of this Diſeaſe, here mentioned, you may adde all the cauſes mentioned in the ninth Chapter: of Defluxions. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> mentioneth many more kinds of Conſumptions, too tedious for me to inſert in this Volume: as thoſe proceeding from nocturnal pollutions, the running of the Reins; alſo the obſtruction of the Nerves, or the flowing of Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to the Back, ſo, of nouriſhment, or drying cauſeth a Conſumption: likewiſe a Diſtillation from the head to the Marrow on the back, may be the cauſe, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> faith; when a Defluxion falleth upon the Spinal Marrow, there is a ſecret, and undiſernable Conſumption. Sometimes it hath its original from hunger, and want of nouriſhment. Sometimes when the Meſeraick Veins are obſtructed, that the Chylus Concocted in the ſtomach, cannot paſſe to the Liver. In the Diagnoſtick, we muſt obſerve the ſignes of a Conſumption, beginning, begun, or confirmed. Signes of a Conſumption beginning are, a ſmall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion, the Lungs not much hurt thereby, the Cough but ſmall; the ſpittle Sweet, Salt, or Bitter; the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a little Feveriſh. The ſignes of a Conſumption begun, the Diſtillation is ſtronger, the Lungs pierced, by which the Lungs are exaſperated, and the Cough violent. The matter contained in the Lungs maketh the ſtomach weighty, a ſharp pain before and behind, from the humors ſuppurating, ſharp and hearing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, fall into the body, and ſometimes into the Veins cauſing a hective Feaver, ſometimes joyned with a Putrid The Lungs, by contracted Filth grow
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115825:94"/> hot; by which heat, flegme and other humors good and bad, are drawn from the brain, which the brain fetcheth from all the body, hence comes its decay and extenuation. The Patient ſpetteth thick rotten Flegm; and doth ſweat at night, as ſoon as he ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. A Conſumption confirmed, is known by theſe ſignes: the Patient ſpitteth matter it ſelf: the Feaver ſtronger: the Cough more violent, with more provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and leſſe Evacuation: the Cough is attended with a hollow ſounding: he ineth and wanteth appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, for the mouth of the ſtomach is weakened by the Defluxion: The belly is looſe, for the Flegm falling from the head, weakeneth the ſtomach and Bowells, and the retentive Faculty is deſtroyed, The Patient breatheth difficult ly, for the faculty is weak, and the Bronchia ſtopped with Putrid Matter: the haire fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth off, the cheeks waxe Blue, and his feet ſwell: the nailes of the fingers are crooked, becauſe the fleſh on the tops of the ſingers, which held them up, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed. Let the Patient ſpit in a Baſon of Faire Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; if he ſpit Matter, it ſinketh; if Flegm, it ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. Thus have I briefly touched upon the cauſes and ſignes of a Conſumption; a word or two of the Prognoſtick. If the Conſumption hath not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and the Ulcer but newly begun, it may be cured; otherwiſe not, for thoſe things which dry the Ulcer, doe hinder ſpitting, and encreaſe the Feaver, and maketh the body leaner. Thoſe things which are moiſt, good againſt leanneſſe and Feavers, doe make the Ulcer fouler. Thoſe that have narrow, and ſtreight breaſts, and their ſhoulder blades ſtick our like wings, are inclinable to Conſumptions, to whom it is natural, for want of natural heat. If the Conſumption came with an acute Diſeaſe; or the ſick
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115825:95"/> fall into an acute Diſeaſe, it killeth ſpeedily. If the Patient ſpitteth ſtinking matter, or cannot ſpit at all; his belly looſe, he is very near Death.</p>
               <p>It would take up a great deal more room, then I have to ſpare, to ſet down the cure of a Conſumption, (I mean when it is only begun, and the Patient ſtrong,) I ſhall only Epitomiſe it. Let the ſick drink Milke warm, either Aſſes, Goars, or Red Cows, but above all the Milke of a ſound woman is the beſt. Let him uſe a coole and moiſt diet, and make uſe of ſuch things, which may correct the Blood, make a decoction of China, Sanders, and Guajacum. You muſt purge the humors offending, but be ſure you make uſe of ſuch purges, as work very gently as Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Rhubarb, Caſſia, Sirrup of Roſes and the like. To allay the Feaver, it is lawful to let Blood, if your Patient be not too lean. You muſt divert the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion, have recourſe to the ninth Chapter. Then you muſt give ſuch things, which have a healing qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to cure the Ulcer, of which the Milk ſpoken of before is very good, and if Sugar of Roſes be given with it, it will be much more available. Conſerve of Roſes is good; if it aſtringe too much, and the breath fail, and the ſick cannot ſpit, make uſe of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectorating medicines, as the Sirrup of Hyſop, Colts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, or Lohocks: the laſt Chapter will enforme you. If hear be procured by the ſame means, give coolers, as the Sirrups of Violets, and Jujubes: the Muſilage of Flealand, Quinces, and the cold ſeeds. The Sirrup of the juice of Ground Ivy is much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by <hi>Quercetan,</hi> ſee the fourth Book of Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups.</p>
               <p>This Sirrup hath admirable virtues. <hi rend="margQuotes">Take of the juice of Grounding, Veronica, and Carduus Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus

The oyle of Vitriol is good to dry the Ulcer, if two or three drops, be given in a morning, with the juyce of Plantane, or Roſe Water and Sugar, ſaith <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas.</hi> The Balſom of Peru, is not without its virtues, for the healing of the Ulcers of the Lungs, if a drop
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115825:96"/> or two be made into a Pill with Sugar, or the Powde of Liquoriſh, and taken every morning; ſo you may take the Balſome of Sulphur. Fumigations may be made of Frakincenſe, Mirrh, Maſtich, Benjamin, Yellow Sanders, Amber, Storax, and the like; and taken in the mouth or noſe, &amp; the roome ſented therewith. Or you may make a moiſt Fumigation of ſuch hearbs, which are freindly to the Lungs. <hi rend="margQuotes">Take of Coltsfoot, Hyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop, Horehound, &amp; Alehoofe, of each two handfulls, bruiſe them and put them in a Pipkin with a cover cloſe Luted on, with water ſufficient; put it into the Oven, when the Bread is half Baked;</hi> the Bread <hi>being Baked draw out the Pipkin,</hi> and put a funnel into a hole which it muſt have at the top, and draw the fumes into the mouth, and put it out at the noſe.

               <p>The Palpitation of the heart is an immoderate, and preternatural ſhaking of the part with a great diaſtole or vehement Syſtole, which ſometimes hath bin ſo great, that the adjoyning ribs have bin

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the Latines <hi>Palpitato Cordis.</hi> The cauſes of it, may be referred to three heads: the firſt is a moleſtation of the heart, ſometimes a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vapor, ariſing from cold and thick humors lodged near the heart, eſpecially the Pericardium, and conveighed to the Ventricles of the heart: or ſent from the ſtomach, Spleen, womb or the like; or cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Plague, poiſon, worms putrified; or the Meſtrues ſtopped, and conveighed as before, may be the cauſe of Palpitation. To theſe, adde exceſſe in quantity or quality, of bloody, Cholerick or watry hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors oppreſſing the Veins, Arteryes or Ventricles of the heart. Likewiſe Inflammation, Impoſthumation, or Tumors happening in the Arteries of the Lungs near the heart, or in the Pericardium, may be the cauſe of Palpitation. A Second cauſe is a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, by which the Spirits are inflamed, and the motion of the heart and Arteries is encreaſed, and this ſometimes (though ſeldome) ariſeth from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cauſe: often from an outward, as anger, violent excerciſe and the like. The third cauſe is the defect of Spirits, cauſed by hunger, watching, anger, joy, fear, ſhame, or great Diſeaſes, or any thing, which diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Spirits, which the heart labouring to recover, encreaſeth its motion, and cauſeth Palpitation. The Diagnoſis or knowledge of this Diſeaſe is eaſie, for it may be felt, heard, or ſeen: The cauſes muſt be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by their proper ſignes. A hot diſtemper is known by often breathing, by a Feaver and heat of the breaſt, and a deſire of cold things. If wind be the cauſe, it is ſubject to Variation, and raiſed by a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115825:97"/> ſmall motion, the breath is difficult; a miſt before the eyes, and a noiſe in the eares &amp;c. If the Diſeaſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from humors in the heart or Pericardium, it comes not ſuddainly, nor goeth away quickly. The nature of the humor you may gather from their Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes. Water in the Peticardium is hard to be known, but we may conjecture it, by the weakneſſe of the Pulſe, the heart ſeems to be almoſt ſuffocated in water. If Malignant and Peſtilent humors cauſe it, the Patient fainteth, a loſſe of the pulſe and ſtrength &amp;c. If it come by conſent from other parts, their proper ſignes declare it. If a Tumor be the cauſe, the motion of the heart is different from the natural, and the pulſe is various: if the Tumor be in the pericardium, and hard, the diſeaſe is conſtant, and the Patient decays without manifeſt cauſe. To the Prognoſtick I ſay, it is a dangerous Symptome, becauſe the motion of the heart, by which life is preſerved, is hindered; and <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that they who are thus affected in youth, or middle age, live not to be old, becauſe the Vitalls are weak in them. <hi>Alpho:</hi> 41 <hi>de loco aff: Sect</hi> 2 <hi>et</hi> 5: <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. If it come from a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, it is incurable; if it be peculiar to the heart, or pericardium, it is incurable. If it come by conſent from other parts, the cure muſt be ſought out of their proper Chapters: but, (ſeeing not only the cauſe ought to be removed, but alſo the Symptomes aſſwaged, by refreſhing the heart) you muſt adminiſter Cordial medicines, which have power to ſtrengthen the heart. If a hot diſtemper vex the heart, <hi rend="margQuotes">Take of the Conſerve of Violets, Water-lillys, Borrage or Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſe flowers, of each one ounce: Diamargariton frigidum, Diarrhodon Abbatis, of each two drachms: Red Sanders, Coral, and Camphire, of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115825:97"/> each a drachm:</hi> with the Sirrups of Coral, Balme, <hi>or Citron peels, make an Opiate,</hi> of which let him take often. If cold humors cauſe the Palpitation: <hi rend="margQuotes">Take of the Conſerve of Roſes, and Roſemary flowers, of each one ounce: Aromaticum Roſarum, Dian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus, and Diambra, of each one drachm: Cinamon, Cloves, and Mace, of each half a drachm: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Alchermes, two ſcruples: Amber, Muſke, and Saffron, of each one ſcruple: with Sirrup of Clove-Gilly-flowers, make an Opiat, and give it as before.</hi> With theſe and the like ingredients the Ingenious may form medicines of all ſorts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the diſeaſe be hot, or cold: likewiſe may Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Unguents, Epithemas, and Sacculibe prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and applyed to the Region of the heart, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and abate the hot or cold diſtempers thereof. If an humor gathered near the heart cauſe the Palpitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, extenuating medicines muſt be mixed with your Cordialls, and if nothing prohibite, open the inner Vein of the arme, called Baſilica; if that appear not, open the middle Vein, which courſe <hi>Galen</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth; alſo if you ſee occaſion adminiſter purging, and Carminative Cliſters.</p>

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115825:98"/> neceſſary influence upon the heart, and vital ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; when they fail, all the reſt muſt ſuffer. This Diſeaſe is diſtinguiſhed from the Epilepſy, which hath a Convulſion, and this not from an Apoplexy, in which the breath is much ſtopped, and the pulſe not much abated, till near death: but here the pulſe faileth and the breath is free. In Fits of the Mother, the breath is moſt obſtructed, the pulſe not much altered, nor the colour of the face, except it be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: the contrary happeneth in a Syncope. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cauſe of this Diſeaſe, is the defect of the Vital Spirits, in which nature is conſtrained, leſt the heart ſhould totally fail, to fetch the ſpirits from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts to the heart, by which means they loſe their functions. This defect happeneth four ways principally: Firſt they are naturally few, by fault in the faculty making of the Vital Spirits; or the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: which fault commeth by diſeaſes proper to the heart, or by conſent from other parts. Proper to the heart, are too much conſtriction, dilation, and Solutions happening to the Ventricles of the heart; or ſuch as deſtroy the natural temper, as Sharp, Malignant, Fainting, Peſtilential, and Hectick Feavers, and the like. The faculty may be hurt by diſeaſes in thoſe parts, which have a Sympathy with the heart, as the Brain, Liver, Stomach, and Womb. The matter is faulty, when the Aire or Blood, (by which the Vital ſpirits are generated) is defective, or corrupted. The aire is defective, when reſpiration, and tranſpiration is hindered: But the hinderance of nutrition cauſeth a defect of the Blood. They are both corrupted, when their qualityes are changed. Secondly this Diſeaſe is cauſed when the Spirits are diſſipated and ſpent, by too great evacuations which may be done ſenſibly,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115825:98"/> or inſenſibly. Senſibly, by inordinate Phlebotomy, Bleeding of wounds, or at the Mouth, Noſe, Womb, Belly, or Hemorrhoids: or an extraordinary diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of other excrementitious humours, by Vomit, Stool, Urine, or Sweat: the breaking of an inward Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume; or by Empyema; or by tapping the Nave lin the Dropſy. Inſenſible evacuations, are cauſed by ſharp or thin humours, which rarifie the skin; or the immoderate heat of Bathes or Hot-Houſes. To theſe add long Watchings, Faſtings, Lechery, Anger, Joy, long continuing, and violent pain or ſickneſs &amp;c. may cauſe a diſſipation of the ſpirits. Thirdly, this diſeaſe is cauſed by things which alter and corrupt the Spirits, as venemous and peſtilential aire and ſtincks, or an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill diſpoſition of the Bowels and other parts; in a word, all things which are averſe to the heart may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the ſpirits. Or Laſtly the ſpirits may be ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or deſtroyed: which may come to paſs, by a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment returning of Blood and Spirits to the Heart; as alſo corrupt vapours, cold and thick blood, and other humours gathered about the Heart, or the adjacent parts. Theſe ſignes ſhew a Syncope, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſudden failing of ſtrength, a ſlow pulſe ſometimes ſtopping, a pale and blewiſh Face, the body externally cold, a cold Sweat, eſpecially on the Temples, Neck, and Breaſt. The ſignes of the Cauſes, for the moſt part, are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, as the ſorts of Feavers, and the external Cauſes, but now named, may be eaſily known. A ſharp Noſe, hollow Eyes, the Temples fallen, are ſignes of thin Humours: gnawing of the Stomach, pricking heat, and great pain, do ſhew that the Body is troubled with Choler. Abundance of crude Humours, is known by the enlarging of the Body, ſwelling of the Breaſt, the colour pale, and the pulſe ſmal, unequal,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115825:99"/> and obſcure. If ſwoonding come by conſent from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts, the Signes of thoſe parts affected will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it. They who often and violently faint without manifeſt Cauſe, dy ſuddenly (ſaith <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>)</p>
               <p>A Syncope, which cometh from ſome evident Cauſe, as Fear, Sorrow, or immoderate Evacuations, is leſſe dangerous then that which cometh from an internal Cauſe. In reſpect of various Cauſes, you muſt vary the Cure. If it come from immoderate Evacuations, you muſt endeavour to ſtop it with their proper Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, preſcribed in their ſeveral Chapters. If from too violent purging, give three graines of Laudanum, or two of Opium. If by too much ſweating, you muſt uſe Medicines which reſtrain Sweat. If from ſuffocation of the Spirits, call them back by Frictions, Ligatures, and Cupping. If it come from Poyſon taken, give ſomthing to expell it; after Vomiting with Oyl, give Treacle: if it burn in the guts, give Milk, fat Broth, or cooling Cordials. If thinneſs of the Humours cauſe it, give things that are ſweet and thickning.</p>
               <p>If want of Food cauſe a Syncope, make uſe of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring Diet, and nouriſhing Broths. To conclude, From what Cauſe ſoever it come, in the Fit, lay your Patient upon his back, throw cold water into his Face, make him ſneez, put <hi>Aqua-vitae, Caeleſtis</hi> or <hi>Imperiales</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Mouth: call him loud, ſtop his Noſtrils, wring his Fingers, pull his Haire, rub, bind, and Cup if need be.</p>

               <p>As there are divers actions of the Stomach, ſo there are divers diſeaſes hindring thoſe actions: <hi>See the fifth Chap. of the firſt Book.</hi> And ſeeing that the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive faculty is the firſt in order, I ſhall begin with the want of Attraction or Appetite. It is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, In Latine <hi>Inappetentia,</hi> In Engliſh <hi>Want of Appetite</hi> or <hi>Loathing of Meat.</hi> That we may rightly judge of the Cauſes of this Diſeaſe, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Natural Cauſes of Appetite and Hunger, by which we may the better diſcover the fault or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The firſt cauſe of Hunger, is emptineſſe of the Stomach: if there be no emptineſſe, there is no Attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor Appetite. Want of emptineſſe, is when the parts are filled with plenty of crude Humours, cauſed by Gluttony or Drunkenneſs; want of Excerciſe or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Evacuations: Weakneſs of the Natural Heat or a Feaver, when the Heat is buſied to concoct the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Diſeaſe, or the like. The Second cauſe of Appetite, is the attraction of Nouriſhment to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, ſometimes this is depraved, though the parts are empty, when the Veins have left their ſtrength by Sickneſs, or immoderate Evacuations. The third cauſe of Appetite, is the Attraction of the Chilus, from the Stomach to the Liver, by the Meſeraick Veins; which cannot be performed if thoſe Veins are obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Chilus ſent out by Siege, and the parts d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their neceſſary Nouriſhment.</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:115825:100"/>
               <p>Fourthly, the faculty of attracting an Appetite requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a good diſpoſition of the ſtomach, brain, and Nerves: conſequently what ever altereth their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions deſtroyeth apperite: great heat and drieth, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing the moiſt ſubſtance of the ſtomach, doth cauſe a want of appetite. The like doth cold, which cauſeth a Stupefaction of the parts, and extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the natural heat.</p>
               <p>Flegmy and Slimy-humors gathered in the ſtomach by evil concoction, or by a defluxion from the head: the ſuppreſſion of the Termes, or Hemorrhoids, ſmoothereth the natural heat, and cauſeth want of attraction. Diſtempers of the Brain and Nerves, maketh a man inſenſible of the attracting in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. The ſigne of the firſt cauſe is known by high feeding, repletion, want of evacuation, the body is full and the Veins Swoln, and the like. The ſecond cauſe is evident, by ſickneſſe, or immoderate evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The third is known by obſtruction of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Spleen, or Meſentery The fourth cauſe is thus known. If there be a great heat in the ſtomach, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, bitterneſſe of the congue and Jaws, and a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, with heart-burning, and the like. All which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a hot diſtemper of the ſtomach; if it flow from ſome other parts; the ſignes of Inflammation of the Liver and other parts will demonſtrate it. A cold diſtemper and much flegm is known by coldneſſe of the ſtomach, great heavineſſe, and ſharp belchings. <hi>Prog:</hi> want of appetite is dangerous, for it is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion from the natural eſtate. Loathing of meat for want of natural heat is farr more dangerous, then when it is cauſed by abundance of evil humors. In children want of appetite is worſe then in men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their natures require more nouriſhment. In all diſeaſes want of Appetite is an evill Symptome.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115825:100"/> If a man recovering wanteth Appetite, there is fear of a Relapſe. If want of Appetite come from a Diſeaſe of ſome other part, I referr you thither for the Cure: but if it be onely in the Stomach, you muſt conſider it as either Hot or Cold. If a hot Humour be the cauſe, purge Choler gently and often, if your Patient be eaſy to vomit, give an eaſy Vomit. Alter the Humours with cooling Sirrups and Juleps, mixing therewith the Spirit of Vitriol, or Sulphur; for all ſharp things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay Choler, and provoke an Appetite. After Purging, Marmalade of Quinces is good, or take this following Opiate: <hi>Take of Conſerve of Wormwood and Sorrel of each one Ounce: Conſerve of Roſes, Succory, and Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſe, of each halfe an Ounce: Diamargariton frigidum, and Diarrhodon Abbatis, of each one Drachm: Troches of Spodium one Scruple, with Sirrup of Lemmons, make an Opiate;</hi> of which let the Patient take the quantity of a Cheſnut, Morning, Night, and Noon. To the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach apply a Roſe Cake ſteeped in Vinegar. Or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint the Stomach outwardly with this Liniment: <hi>Take of Oyle of Roſes, Martles, and Quinces, waſhed with Vinegar of Roſes, of eath two Ounces: all the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, red Corall, Coriander ſeed prepared, and red Roſes, of each one Drachm: the graines of Kermes and Spodium, of each half a Drachm: White Wax as much as is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make a Liniment,</hi> and anoint the Stomach often therewith.</p>
               <p>If a cold Diſtemper of the Stomach, draw crude, flegmatick, and inelancholy Humours thither from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts: you muſt amend the Diſtempers of thoſe parts with Medicines, laid down in their proper Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Then you muſt evacuate the Humours oppreſſing the Stomach; and afterwards ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it. You muſt evacuate the Humours, either<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Vomit or Stool; give no Vomits, but to thoſe who
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115825:101"/> are eaſy to vomit. Of Purges, Pills are moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe of their long continuance in the Stomach: the laſt Booke will furniſh you with purging Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. If the Humours in the Stomach be tough, you muſt diſſolve them with Hony of Roſes, Oxymel, and the like.</p>
               <p>Beware how you adminiſter Pills, which are ſtrong in operation, leſt they draw Humours from other parts to the Stomach. If the Liver be very hot you may be let Blood, otherwiſe not; and in this caſe, you muſt adminiſter ſuch things as cool the Liver. After ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Purging, you muſt come to ſtrengthen the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, internally and externally: <hi>Take of the Sirrup of Wormwood, and Quinces, of each two Ounces: the Sirrup of Citron Peels, one Ounce: Cinnamon water, four Ounces: the Spirit of Sulphur, ten Drops: mix them,</hi> and let the Patient take a Spoonfull or two, Morning, Noon, and Night, or oftner, as neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. <hi>Quercetanus</hi> his Sirrup of Cinnamon is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, See the laſt Book. If the Diſeaſe be of long continuance, let the Patient make uſe of the Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum Drink, preſcribed in the Second Chapter of this Book; the bath of <hi>Bath</hi> is profitable in this Caſe.</p>
               <p>But if a hot Liver attend a cold Stomach, as it often doth, your Medicines ought to be the more temperate, <hi>Zechius</hi> commendeth this Bolus; <hi>Take of waſhed Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine two Drachms: Powder of Maſtich half a Drachm: Aromaticum Roſarum, half a Scruple; make a Bolus;</hi> and let the Sick take it two hours before Meat. Candied Nutmegs and Ginger is good: and it is convenient for the Patient to drink his Beer warm. This Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is good, <hi>Take of the Balſom of Peru, three Ounces: the Oyles of Nutmegs, Wormwood, and Maſtich, of each one Ounce; mix them and anoint the Stomach:</hi> Alſo
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115825:101"/> with theſe and other ingredients, which have a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and expectorating Quality you may make Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents and Plaiſters, to be applyed to the Stomach.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The Appetite is depraved two wayes: Either in Quantity or Quality. If it be depraved in Quantity, Nouriſhment is deſired in greater quantity then Nature would: it is called by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by the Latines <hi>Fames Canina,</hi> whence we call it, <hi>Dogg's Appetite.</hi> It is depraved in Quality, when things, which are not Food, but vitious and unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, are deſired, This is called in Greek, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <p>Firſt, thoſe that are troubled with the <hi>Dogg's Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,</hi> do feed inſatiably, and afterwards ſome do vomit like Dogg's, ſome do purge, and others do digeſt it, and if they have not more preſently, are ſick. The part affected, is chiefly the mouth of the Stomach: The Cauſe containing, is Senſe of ſucking and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pulling, which ſtirrs up the Appetite. Vicious Humours ſticking to the mouth of the Stomach, by their too much Coldneſs; Sharpneſs or Sowrneſs do bind, wrinkle, and pull the mouth of the Stomach, and ſo beget a falſe Appetite; Melancholy, ſent from the Spleen to the Stomach, if it exceed and be praeternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, cauſeth an unnatur all Appetite. It may be cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by want of Food, and Emptineſs cauſed by too great Evacuations, by which the Veins do continually ſuck.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:115825:102"/>
               <p>Somtimes it cometh from Wormes in the Stomach, which devour the Chilus. The Hermetick Phyſitians do attribute it to a ſharp, ſalt, and devouring Spirit or Faculty in the Stomach: which doth readily conſume what ever Meat is taken, as Aqua Fortis doth quickly diſſolve the fixedſt Mettals, the hardeſt Stones into Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; and by this meanes, doth not allow Nature a lawful and neceſſary bound of Nouriſhment. The Diſeaſe it ſelf, needs no other Signe, then the devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Meat. The ſignes of the Cauſes may be eaſily found; they which manifeſt a cold Diſtemper, and ſharp Humours in the Stomach, are belching and ſharp vomiting, crude Ejections, want of Thirſt, and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſes of Refrigeration. If defect of Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the Cauſe, the Patient is Lean, and there are Cauſes preſent, or a foregoing of the decay of Moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If Wormes be the Cauſe, in the Chapter of the Wormes, their ſignes ſhall be ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prog:</hi> If this Diſeaſe, come from external Cauſes, or from Wormes, it is not dangerous: Judge the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if it follow Emptineſſe, and great Evacuations: or if the Patient doth vomit or purge much, for then the Body (for the moſt part) falleth into a worſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. To cure this Diſeaſe, you muſt purge, by Vomit or Stools, (taking the Caution in the laſt Chapter) the Phlegmatick and Melancholy Humours, ſticking to the Stomach; Then you muſt labour to ſtrengthen the Stomach with internal and external Medicines, preſcribed in the former Chapter. Six graines of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergreaſe taken in a reere Egg, hath a ſpecial Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſtrengthen the Stomach, and cure the Diſeaſe. Narcotick Medicines, by dulling the exquiſite Senſe, do ſometimes cure the Diſeaſe, but muſt not be uſed till all other meanes fail, and then adviſed by an able Brain.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:115825:102"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith that Wine and Aqua vitae is good: and experience teacheth, that Oyl and Fat things, are ſeldom given without Succeſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pica</hi> and <hi>Malacia</hi> is a depraved Appetite, by which unprofitable and hurtfull things are deſired. It is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the eating of evil Meats, by which, the Stomach is diſpoſed for the production of Melancholy and Phlegmatick Humours, hence divers Apperites of evill things are engendred. Some deſire things that are ſowr, ſharp, bitter, and cold; as Vinegar, Juyce of Lemmons and Orenges, cold Water, Snow, Ice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe Fruits, and the like. Some do deſire earthly, dry, and burnt things; as Nutmegs, Cloves, Cinnamon, and other Spices: Salt, Aſhes, Coles, Chalk, Tobacco-Pipes, Lime, Oat-meal, Tar, Candles, and ſuch like. This Diſeaſe happeneth, for the moſt part, to Women with Child, or to Maids which have the Green-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, who having their Termes ſtopped, and ſtaying, corrupteth the Body, and aſcending, infecteth the Stomach, and taketh the Appetite from its Natural Condition. Sometimes (though ſeldom) Men and Boyes, are thus troubled: <hi>Fernelius</hi> ſpeaks of a Noble man, who having an extraordinary Appetite to Lime, did devour a piece as big as his fiſt, without offending his Stomach or Bowels. The Cauſe of this Diſeaſe may be found out by the things deſired: For if they deſire Coles, Salt, or the like, we may conclude, that the Diſeaſe depends upon ſalt and burnt Humours.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is Chronical, and of Continuance, but is ſeldom dangerous: yet ſomtimes if the Stomach cannot be reduced to its former Condition, Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Evill habits, Dropſies, and Cardialgiaes, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. The more contrary to Nature the things deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red are, the farther diſtant is the Stomach from the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:115825:103"/> Natural Temper. If you aim at the Cure, it differeth not from the former: but you muſt conſider the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Bodyes affected. If this Diſeaſe happen to a Man, it hath its original from the Obſtruction of the Liver and Spleen, and you muſt ſeek the Cure in their proper Chapters. If Women with Child are thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, be ſparing in giving Medicines, for fear of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage: for the moſt part they are freed of it in the fourth Moneth. If the <hi>Green-ſickneſs</hi> in Maids be the Cauſe of this Effect; ſeek the Cure in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Green-ſickneſs.</hi>

                  </gap>; in Latine <hi>Sitis Morboſa;</hi> The immediate Cauſe is Want of moiſt Nouriſhment: Drineſſe of the Stomach and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts, which maketh the Stomach ſenſible of their wants: It is cauſed by thoſe things, which have a Power to conſume and dry up the Moiſture of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and whole Body. It is cauſed alſo by Propriety or Sympathy: by Propriety, when the Moiſture of the Stomach is altered or drawne forth by a hot, dry, ſalt, ſharp, or filthy Humour, contained in his Cavity. By Sympathy, when the whole Body, or ſome particular Member, having loſt its Moiſture, doth ſuck Moiſture from the Stomach: For the Veins having loſt their Moiſture, endeavour to recruite themſelves with the Stomach's moiſture, as it happeneth in Feavers, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations of the Liver, Lungs, and a hot and dry
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115825:103"/> Diſtemper of the Reins, cauſeth Diabetes or a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Piſſing, and is accompanied with great Thirſt, and therefore is called Dipſacus. The outward cauſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are all ſuch things as heat and dry: the uſe of ſalt, ſharp, and ſpiced Meats; Exceſs of old rich Wine: Watchings, or immoderate Evacuations. The Sons of <hi>Hermes</hi> conclude, that praeternatural Thirſt is cauſed by thirſty Spirits, bred of ſulphureous Excrements: whoſe Thirſt cannot be ſatisfied with ordinary cooling Medicines: unleſſe the ſharp ſpirits of Vitriol, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, or Salt, be added to them.</p>
               <p>The Knowledge of the Diſeaſe is eaſy, of the Cauſe, and the Part affected, not difficult. Of the Diſeaſe, the Patients Complaint for want of Drink, will inform you: Likewiſe the Cauſe may be diſtinguiſhed, by the Taſts, which are hot, dry, ſalt, bitter, ſharp, and the like. Laſtly, the Taſts do not onely diſtinguiſh the peccant Humour, but alſo that the part affected is the Mouth of the Stomach: but if Thirſt come by conſent from other parts, the Signes of thoſe Diſeaſes will be manifeſt. The Thirſt which comes from external Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is eaſily quenched with Drink: that which comes from internal Cauſes, are more or leſſe dangerous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their differences. Thirſt accompanying Feavers, ends with them, and their Cures ſhall be ſet down in their proper places. Thirſt in a Dropſy is not allayed, but rather encreaſed by Drink, and is moſt dangerous. If it be cauſed by immoderate Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Suppreſs the Evacuations, and reſtore the Empty Parts with cooling and moiſtning Medicines, ſuch as are preſcribed in the Cure of the Feaver Hectick and Maraſmus.</p>

               <p>The Concoction of the Stomach is hurt three wayes: <hi>viz.</hi> it may be diminiſhed, depraved, or aboliſhed, Concoction diminiſhed is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The fault of Concoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is either in the Organ, Object, External or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things. The fault in the Organ comprehendeth all Diſeaſes in the Stomach: For ſince digeſtion is made in the Stomack by a moderate natural Heat, if it want its Moderation, the digeſtive Faculty is hurt. A cold Diſtemper of the Stomach, if it be gentle, diminiſheth the Heat, and weakneth Concoction. If it be greater it aboliſheth it: A hot diſtemper in the Stomach de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praveth the Faculty, and cauſeth difficult Concoction.</p>
               <p>Though theſe Diſtempers are ſomtimes ſimple, yet many times, they are joyned with Matter, as Phlegm, and black Humours cauſed by Hypocondriack Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, which cauſe Crudities, ſowr Belchings, Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, Winds, and the like. The fault of the Object is thus conſidered, when the Nouriſhment, which is the proper Object of the Stomach, offendeth, in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Quantity, Quality, or Time. Nouriſhment offendeth the Stomach, in Subſtance, when it is too hard and difficult to be concocted. In Quantity, it offendeth the Stomach, when either too much is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at once, that the natural Heat cannot digeſt it, but ſome part of it remaineth Crude: Leſſe taken then Nature requireth, becometh Crude alſo, when it is
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115825:104"/> dryed or burnt in a Cholerick Stomach. In Quality, Food offendeth, when it is either too hot, or dry, or too cold, moiſt, and windy for the Stomach. In reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Time, Nouriſhment may offend the Stomach, If a Man contrary to his order in Diet, doth eat libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a little before he goeth to Bed, this may hurt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction. External or internal Meanes may hurt the concoctive Faculty: Namely, an Aire too hot may diſſipate the natural Heat; an Aire too cold may dull it: Immoderate Excerciſe, eſpecially after Meat, draweth the Heat from the Stomach to the External parts; and drives the imperfect Chylus into the Guts, and ſo weakens Concoction. Coſtiveneſs of the Belly, or a Flux; immoderate Watching, or ſleep in the day time; deep Study upon a full Stomach; Sadneſs and other Paſſions of the Mind, do hinder the Actions of the Stomach. The Hermetick Phyſitians add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſe, for they ſay (and not without reaſon) that a ſharp Liquor ſent from the Spleen to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which hath a great power to diſſolve, in its Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral State, cauſeth a laudable Concoction; &amp; that conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not made by Heat onely: For Meat boyled in a Pot, with a ſtrong Heat many dayes, is not diſſolved: and Bones in a Doggs Stomach are quickly diſſolved: Likewiſe Fiſhes do quickly diſſolve their Meat, though they have no actuall Heat. Birds do quickly concoct the hardeſt Seeds, and ſmall pebble Stones, and they have a Spleen round about their Maw; and that there is a diſſolving Spirit inhaerent in the Gizzards of Birds, the Phyſical practice doth prove, being often uſed in Medicines to help Concoction, diſſolve the Stone, and the like.</p>
               <p>The Signes of a diminiſhed or aboliſhed Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the ſame, differing onely in Degrees: <hi>viz.</hi> ſowr
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115825:105"/> Belchngs, Vomiting or Purging forth of Food either not well, or not at all concocted; Weight, Extenſion, and Inflammation of the Stomach; the Patient ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſome cold Cauſe going before, and is worſe by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of cold things: the Urine thin, &amp; pale like Water, and ſometimes thick and red. If the concoctive Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be depraved, the Patient is ſenſible of ſtinking Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, and the like Taſt in the Mouth, of Heat and Thirſt; and is prejudiced by Hot things. If it come from external Cauſes, the Patient, or ſome about him will be able to demonſtrate it; if it come by conſent from other Parts, their Signes muſt be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Concoction hurt by conſent from other Parts, is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier cured, then that, which is proper to the Stomach, onely that which cometh from external Cauſes, is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red eaſieſt of all. Concoction diminiſhed, though it be not the worſt, yet it bringeth many inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as the Chollick, Chachexy, and ſomtimes the Dropſy.

It is cauſed (according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi>) of Fulneſſe or Emptineſſe; ſometimes (ſaith <hi>Galen</hi>) by Provocation. The matter cauſing the <hi>Hiccough,</hi> is either gathered in the Stomach; or is ſent from other Parts. Sharp Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, Nouriſhment, or Medicines; or gnawing Worms in the Stomach, may cauſe a Hiccough by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety: It is cauſed by conſent, when the Liver, Spleen, Guts, or other Parts, being inflamed, ſend offenſive Vapours, or Water to the Stomach. A Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in the Liver (being inflamed) doth compreſſe the Stomach, and ſo provoke the expulſive Faculty; finally, ſharp Humours, ſent from all parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in malignant Feavers, may be the cauſe of the Hiccough. Diagnoſtick ſignes are, if the Diſeaſe come by Propriety, it is more laſting, and is eaſed by Vomit: the ſignes of the Humours in the Stomach, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the Taſt in the Mouth, Belchings, &amp;c. If it come from any other part of the Body, their proper Signes will declare it. Prognoſticks are. If the <hi>Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough</hi> be cauſed by Meat, Drink, of Cold, it is not dangerous. But if it come in a malignant or great Feaver, and continue, it is deadly. The ſame you may judge, if the Hiccough (accompanied with redneſs of the Eyes, in an acute Diſeaſe) invade the Patient af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Vomiting. <hi>Singultus</hi> from the inflammation of the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115825:106"/> Liver is alſo hurtfull. For the cure, you muſt, (if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe come from a cold cauſe,) Firſt, adminiſter medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, which do cut and prepare the Humours, as Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and Oxymel of Squils, and Oxymel Simplex: then evacuate the Humours by Purge or Vomit, and then ſtrengthen the Stomach: uſe the Medicines pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Chapter of <hi>Want of Appetite,</hi> comming of a cold Cauſe: if the Diſeaſe be violent, add theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: <hi>Take of Caſtor and Mirrh, of each, three Drachms: Sal Gem, half an Ounce: Diagridium and Maſtich, of each, one Drachm: Agarick newly trochiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted three Drachms: Aloes, the weight of all the reſt: with the juice of Mints: make them up into a Maſs, and of one Drachm make ſix gilded Pills:</hi> Let your Patient take two or three in the Morning. <hi>Riverius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Wind in the Stomach be the Cauſe: <hi>Take of Dill-Seed, Sweet Fennell and Annis-Seed, of each one Ounce, Juniper Berries, half an Ounce: Cloves, a Drachm: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate them in good Wine, or Spirit of Wine, and diſtill it in Baineo.</hi> If ſharp and chollerick Humours be the cauſe of the Hiccough, you muſt give Oyl of Sweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Priſan Broth, Sirrup of Apples and Quinces, &amp; the Emulſion of the Cold Seeds: foment the Stomach with a Spung dipt in Roſe Water, or apply a cooling Oyntment to the Stomach.

                  <hi>Vomiting,</hi> differ onely in Degrees: the firſt, is a Deſire to vomit up, what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever troubles the Stomach, either in Quantity or Quality, but cannot, either by reaſon of the weakneſſe or the Stomach, ſtrength of the upper Orifice, or thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or ſlimineſſe of the Matter. But Vomiting is a depraved motion of the Stomach, which ſhaketh it, by which the expulſive Faculty is ſtirred up, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the Fibres of the Lower part, and looſening the Superior, and with a violent motion caſteth forth the Matter contained therein, which was trouble ſome to it. The Cauſes of Vomiting are external or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and is divided into Natural or Artificial: the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural is either without or in a Diſeaſe, and is thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, it is either Periodical, Critical, or Symptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical. Periodical vomiting, is without a Diſeaſe, and is uſed by many twice in a year or oftener, to cleanſe the Stomach of cholerick or phlegmatick Humours, and to prevent Diſeaſe. Critical vomiting, is when Nature, in a diſeaſe, caſts forth her Enemy. Sympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical vomiting, is when Nature is provoked and weakned, and is not eaſed by it, becauſe ſhe is not ſtrong enough utterly to expel it: the Matter vomited is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Excrements: as Phlegm, Choler, Melancholy, Water, Matter, Wormes, and the like: or Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Meat, Chylus, or Blood. Artificial Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, is from an external Cauſe: as Compreſſion of the lower Belly, Stroaks, Falls, violent Excorciſe, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Sayling on the Sea, Poyſonous Aire, or Breath,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115825:107"/> ſtinking Smels, or beholding ſome Filthy thing. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cauſes may provoke Nature, as Vomits taken; Some Nouriſhment is diſtaſtful to ſome Stomachs, and cauſeth vomiting: <hi>Hippoceates</hi> reporteth that one eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Muſhtooms died vomiting: Meats which are Fat &amp; Oyly are praepoſterous to ſome Stomachs: Omitting Gluttony, which is many times the Cauſe. The whole Body in a Plethory, evil Habit, Feavers, and other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the Body, may be the Cauſe: Inflammations or Obſtructions of other Parts, as the Liver, Spleen, Meſentery, or Bowels, the Terms or Hemorrhoids ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, a Catarrh, or the like may cauſe Vomiting. If Vomiting be cauſed by Humours offending the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, or by an Organical diſeaſe therein, you may find the ſignes thereof in the praeceding Chapters of diſeaſes of the Stomach. If it come by Sympathy from other Parts, their proper ſignes will informe. Make the <hi>Prognoſtick</hi> thus: Choler and Phlegme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely mingled and vomited up, is good. If the Sick vomit Critically, and caſt forth Choler in a cholerick Diſtemper, and Phlegm in a phlegmatick, it is hopeful. Violent vomiting, and little brought up, in a Feaver is evil: for it ſhews abundance of Matter, or that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is weak. Vomiting, after a Flux of the Belly, is good, for there is a revulſion of the Matter, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is refreſhed. Vomiting of divers Colours is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, becauſe Nature hath to do with divers Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Green, blew, black, and ſtinking Matter vomited, is deadly. In Feavers acute, if the Patient vomit without mixture of Humours, it is an evil ſigne, becauſe that a pure Humour is not capable of Concoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the Cure: If the Diſeaſe come by conſent from other parts, remove the Cauſe by working their Cures. If phlegmatick, cholerick, or melancholy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours provoke the Stomach, caſt them forth by vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115825:107"/> prepare and cut them if they be tough and clammy. Give gentle Vomits, as warm Oyl: or white Vitriol prepared: or Salt of Vitriol made red by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination, for they cleanſe and diſſolve the glutinous Matter. If your Patient be weak and indiſpoſed to Vomits, give often Cliſters or purge the Body with this or the like Pills. <hi>Take de Aloe lota, three Drachms; yellow Myrabolans, and Rubarb in Powder, of each, half a Drachm: red Sanders, and prepared Coral, of each, one Scruple: with the Sirrup of Roſes ſolutive, make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Maſs:</hi> give a Drachm every other or third day: and if the Sick be weak, give but half ſo much. If the Vomiting be violent, give two Scruples and an half of <hi>Cochie the leſſe,</hi> with three grains of <hi>Laudanum</hi> in the morning. Then you muſt ſtrengthen the Stomach, with the ſirrup or conſerve of Quinces, conſerve of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Maſtick in a ſmall quantity, ſirrup of Mints, Plantane water made ſowr with Oyl of Vitriol, &amp;c. All theſe ſtrengthen the Stomach and ſtay Vomiting, of which you may make Medicines in divers forms. Foment the Stomach with a ſponge dipt in Plantane water, Roſe water, and Roſe Vinegar. But Firſt, boil in the water a handful of Mints.

                  </gap> in Greek, and <hi>Cholerica Paſſio</hi> in Latine, is a Diſeaſe, violently ſending forth by Vomit &amp; Stool, ſharp and cholerick Humours: this Diſeaſe is a ſymptom of the expulſive Faculty being hurt, by Meats not well concocted, and if the retentive Faculty be alſo in fault, the Diſeaſe is the worſe and more violent. Some will have two ſorts of Choller, a moiſt and a dry; A moiſt is that which hath relation to what hath been ſaid. The dry is more rare, and cometh from a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſpirit, produced in the Stomach, by the fiery Heat of the Part corrupting the Meat: or by Meats which are Rank and Windy, and this is the opinion of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> himſelf. <hi>Sennertus</hi> (from the Hermetical doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine) addeth another Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Salt and aduſt Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the <hi>Hypochonaria,</hi> which grow hot by the mixture of another Humour, and demonſtrateth it, by the mixing of Aqua fortis, and Oyl of Vitriol, with Salt of Tartar, which produce very flatuous Spirits. So that the immediate Cauſes of this Diſeaſe are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick, burnt, ſharp, ſalt, or rotten Humours in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Bowels, Spleen, Meſentery; or ſome Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an evil Quality, or ſome ſtrong Medicine, or Poyſon taken. The ſignes of this Diſeaſe are often and plentiful Evacuations of cholerick, ſharp, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Humours, by Vomit and Stool: ſwelling with Wind, Thirſt, and a Gnawing of the Stomach and Guts: a Loathing, which is appeaſed a little with cold Drink which is ſoon after caſt up. The Pulſe is ſmall
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115825:108"/> and unequal: Sweating, with Convulſion of extream Parts, &amp; Swooning, and ſuch dangerous Symptoms. It is eaſily diſcovered whether the Cauſe come by ſome violent Medicine, Poyſon, or offenſive Diet. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cauſes are known by the Quality of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, that are ejected. If there be a continual Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Gnawing, the Diſeaſe is in the Stomach. If a malignant Feaver be joyned, it is in the Veins. If it hath its original from ſome evil Food, there is hopes, that when the Matter is caſt forth the Diſeaſe will end. If it be very violent, it is dangerous, I had almoſt ſaid deſperate: for the greater the Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Swoonings, and Coldneſſe of the extream Parts be, the nearer is Death at hand.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the Cure, you may help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Evacuations, with gentle, cooling, and cleanſing Cliſters, thus: <hi>Take, of Milk, half a pint; Sirrup of Violets, and Lettice, of each one ounce: The Oyles of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and water Lillyes, of each halfe an ounce; The yelks of two new laid Eggs well beaten, mix them and give it.</hi> Or you make a Cliſter with Chicken Broth or Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate. It is good to open a Vein, by which means, the burnt and boiling Blood may be cooled, revelled, and aſſwaged: but do it with diſcretion, twice or thrice if the ſtrength be not impaired by the firſt. You muſt endeavour to qualify the ſharpneſs of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, thus: <hi>Take, of the waters of Plantane, Purſlan, and Mint, of each, two Ounces: Sirrup of Quinces and dried Roſes, of each, one Ounce; Sirrup of Vinegar, half an Ounce; mix them, and diſſolve therein two Scruples of Theriack Andromachi, and ſix drops of the Oyl of Vitriol: give now and then a Spoonful.</hi> But, if the Patient hath ſomeeaſe, and the Symptomes abate, or appear not, beware leſt they ſuddenly return and deſtroy the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, as it ſometimes happeneth in this caſe.

                  <hi>Dolor Ventriculi</hi> or Pain in the Stomach, is cauſed by naughty, venemous, and gnawing Humours contained therein: the Ancients made this diſtinction, <hi>viz.</hi> that if the upper Orifice of the Stomach, which is of exquiſite ſenſe, by reaſon of the great Nerve, which it hath from the fifth Conjugation, be affected; the Pain is very ſharp, which maketh the Heart, (the moſt Noble part, and near unto it) ſenſible of the ſame, from thence it is called <hi>Cardialgia.</hi> But if the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Cavity, or lower Orifice (called <hi>Pylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>) be affected, it is called <hi>Dolor Ventriculi:</hi> or <hi>Coli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca Ventriculi,</hi> eſpecially if it comes of Wind. The Cauſe of this Diſeaſe, is either Worms gnawing the Tunicles of the Stomach: or Wind lodged in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Stomach, which cauſeth Swelling and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115825:109"/> Diſtenſion: or ſharp and malignant Humours therein contained, as ſalt Phlegm, green and black Choller, whoſe ſharp Vapours cauſe Pain: corrupt Matter from an Impoſthume of the Liver or the Breaſt; Diſeaſes of the Stomach and the Parts adjoyning; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Humours from the whole Body in Feavers; Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler from the Liver; Melancholy from the Spleen; and ſalt Phlegm from the Head; all theſe may be the Cauſes of this Evill. The external Cauſes may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and corrupt Nouriſhment; or Meats that are too hot; that breed Wind or Choller: Meat taken in too great a Quantity: Poyſon: ſtrong, ſharp, and deadly Medicines, not well corrected. Diagnoſtick Signes are thus taken: when the Pain is under the Enſiformis, it ſhews that the upper Orifice of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is affected: a very ſharp Pain, that the Patient cannot reſt, and ſometimes fainteth: the Vapours ſometimes offend the Brain, and cauſe inveterate Head-Ach, the Megrim, Vertigo, and Epilepſy. In the other parts of the Stomach, there are not ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Symptomes, but great Paines like the Chollick. Thus you may know the Cauſes. The Humours offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, may be known by the Excrements avoided at the Belly or Mouth: alſo Choller, Phlegm, Wind, or Worms may be knowne by their proper Signes. The Diſeaſes of the Stomach or parts adjoyning, cauſing this Diſeaſe, may be known by their proper Signes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prog:</hi> This Diſeaſe is more dangerous then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſeaſe of the Stomach: The danger is greater if a Feaver accompany it: if the extream Parts be cold, Death is at hand: thus ſaith <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> It is leaſt dangerous if it proceed from Worms; yet ſometimes dangerous Symptoms appear, and the Patient dyes: ſometimes, if the cauſe of Wind cannot be removed, a dry Dropſy followeth. If it come from other Parts,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115825:110"/> there begin your Cure; if it be in the Stomach pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, conſider the peccant Humour. If Wind be the Cauſe, firſt, adminiſter a Cliſter: <hi>Take of Camomil, Penny-royall, Miats, and Pellitory of the Wall, of each, one handful: the Seeds of Anniſe, Fennel, Cummin, and Dill, of each, two Drachms: make a Decoction in white Wine Poſſet Drink: add Benedicta Laxativa, half an Ounce: the Oyls of Dill, Rue, and Chamomil, of each half an Ounce: the Chymical Oyl of Juniper Berries, ten Drops, make a Cliſter,</hi> and give it or the like, as often as need requireth. Make a Fomentation, with the Herbs and Seeds aforeſaid, or with others of the like Nature: then anoint the Stomach with the Oyls of Sage and Cloves Chymical, Oyl of Dill, Camomil, Rue, and the like. Then adminiſter this or the like Julep, which hath power to aſſwage Pain, diſcuſſe Wind, and ſtrengthen the Stomach: <hi>Take of Wormwood, Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyall, Century the leſſe, and Agrimony, of each, one handful: the Flowers of Camomill, and Juniper Berryes, of each, one Ounce: the Seeds of ſweet Fennel, and Aniſe, of each, two Drachms: Boil them in a Quart of white wine to the conſumption of half, ſweeten it with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Sirrups of Wormwood and Betony, of each, two Ounces.</hi> Let the Patient take a ſpoonful of this often, and ſix ſpoonfuls Night and Morning: this have I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten proved with good ſucceſſe, let the Cauſe be what it will. If the Diſeaſe be yet too ſtubborn to yeeld to ordinary Medicines, make a Bath of mollifying Herbs, and let the Patient ſit in it, giving inward diſcuſſing Medicines. In vehement Pain, ſome do give a Purge, and mix Narcoticks with it, to allay the Pain, and this following is much commended by <hi>Foreſtus: Take of Diaphenicon, half an Ounce: Philonium Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, two Scruples: with Camomil water, (in want thereof, the Decoction) make a Potion.</hi> If Choller cauſe

               </head>
               <p>The Inflammation of the Stomach is a Tumor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Blood, ſent into the Stomach and its Membranes, from the <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> by the ſmall Veins; which Blood is either pure, and maketh a proper Phlegm; or mixed with Choller, and maketh an Eriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelatous, or with Phlegm, making an Oedmatous, or with Melancholy, making a Schirrous Tumor. In a word, all things that may inflame the Blood, may be the Cauſe of this Tumor. Diagnoſtick Signes are, great Pain, burning, pricking, diſtending, beating, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Back: you may ſee or feel the Tumor; bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and ſometimes vomiting of Blood, and the Breath is ferched difficultly, and a burning Feaver. If it be onely of Blood, it is ſomwhat gentler: but if it be with Choller, there are grievcus Symptoms. But be carefull to diſtinguiſh this Inflammation, from that of the upper ſide of the Liver: ſee the Chap. <hi>of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Liver.</hi> This Diſeaſe for the moſt part is deadly. If the Inflammation be in the upper part of the Stomach, or over the whole, or much loathing of the Stomach, or rumbling in the Belly, all theſe are deadly Symptoms. If the Inflammation kill not, and the Feaver and Pain ceaſeth, and the Tumor remain, then it turns to an Impoſthume; which being broken, there remaineth an Ulcer, which is known by voiding
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:115825:111"/> of Matter by Vomit and Stool. But an Ulcer may be bred in the Stomach from other Cauſes, as ſharp, ſalt, cholerick Humours bred in the Stomach, or ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from other parts: the breach of a Vein, which could not grow together again: a Wound not well cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Poyſon, or corroding Medicines taken. The Signes of an Ulcer bred in the Stomach, are the ſame with the former; to which I add theſe: a conſtant lingring Feaver, ſtinking Belching, no Appetite, a pricking Pain and Burning, when any thing is taken, which is hot, cold, ſharp, ſalt, or ſowr. This Diſeaſe for the moſt part is deadly, becauſe Cleanſers encreaſe Pain, and Dryers cannot execute their Office, but are hindred by Meat, Drink, and Chylus. The Cure of theſo Diſeaſes, muſt be diverſly conſidered.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is cauſed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious Matter, retained too long, and, by diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, pricking, or corroding, cauſeth grievous pain. Sometimes it is cauſed through Crudities, bred by a cold Diſtemper of the Stomach and Inteſtines, which cauſeth Wind to afflict the Guts (being obſtructed) eſpecially the Gut <hi>Coion:</hi> ſometimes cold, groſſe, and phlegmatick Humours, ſticking to the Tunicles or Coats of the Guts, cauſe conſtriction, and divulſion, and a gnawing pain: alſo ſalt, and ſharp, cholerick, and melancholy, ſowr Humours, by pricking and twitching the Cuts, cauſe Pain. Here note, that if Wind or Humours remain onely in the Cavity of the Guts, they might be eaſily excluded, by evacuating, cleanſing, and curminative Medicines; but being (for the moſt part)
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115825:112"/> fixed to the Coats of the Guts, they are not expelled without difficulty. There are other leſſe uſual Cauſes of the Chollick, <hi>viz.</hi> Tumors in the adjoyning parts, cauſing compreſſion of the Guts: Tumors and Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations in the Inteſtines cauſing Narrowneſſe: Knots of Worms, or Stones bred in the Guts which ſtop them: ſometimes a poyſonous and malignant Matter engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth a peſtilent Chollick or Plague in the Guts. The External cauſes are, either a cold Aire, which doth conſtringe the Belly; or an Air too hot, indurating the Excrements: Raw Fruit, Meats groſſe and of hard Digeſtion; in a Word, every thing which diſturbeth the concoction of the Stomach, may here be taken for an External cauſe. Diagnoſtick Signes are, a very ſharp pain ſometimes moveable, ſometimes in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Stomach, Liver, Spleen, Reins: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times above, and ſometimes beneath the Nayel; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in the left ſide; ſo that by compariſon of other Signes you muſt diſtinguiſh between this and the Spleen and Stone. The Pain is like the Boaring of an Auger, he vomiteth chole rick and phlegmatick Matter, if the Stomach conſenteth. The pain is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter after Meat: the Belly (for the moſt part) is bound, that the Patient cannot ſo much as break Wind: when he voideth Excrements, they are windy, like Cow dung with Water on the Top. The cauſes are alſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by their Signes: If Phlegm be the cauſe, the pain is not ſo violent, the Sick hath uſed a phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Diet; but if Wind be joyned with it, the part ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth as if it were boared through with a Wimble; the Urine is crude and white, yet ſometimes the violent Pain enflameth the Spirits, and the Urine appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth yellow or red: He is better for hot, and the worſe for cold things. If cholerick Humours cauſe the Chollick, there is a violent, pulling, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115825:113"/> pricking Pain; the Urine is cholerick; a Diet breeding Choller went before, he is the worſe for hot Medicines; there is great Heat, Thirſt. and ſometimes a Feaver. If the Chollick proceed from Wind, there is a ſtretching Pain and the Belly ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and the Wind rumbleth therein, he findeth eaſe when he breaketh it: If the Wind be in the Cavity, the Pain is moveable, and encreaſeth and decreaſeth; If in the Coats of the Guts, the Pain is fixed in reſpect of place, and conſtant. Prognoſtick ſignes are, It the Chollick be gentle, moveable, and the Belly ſoluble, it is eaſily cured: on the contrary, if the Pain be great and fixed, the Belly bound, the Patient wanteth Sleep, vomiteth, and is troubled; with cold Sweats, Hiccoughs, Doting, and Coldneſſe of the extream parts, it is alwayes dangerous, and (for the moſt part) deadly. An Epidemical and peſtilent Chollick is very d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>You muſt vary the Cure, according to the diverſity of Cauſes; if Phlegm and Wind be the cauſe, you muſt adminiſter an emollient, diſcuſſing, and carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Cliſter, (See Chap. 41 <hi>Of Pain in the Stomath</hi>) three or four times in a day. Or make a Decoction of emollient and carminative Herbs, and boil therein three Drachms of Colloquintida. If two or three Cliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters provoke not to Stool, make uſe of this Suppoſitory: <hi>Take of Hony ſodden, half an Ounce: Hiera piera, one Drachm: Diacolo-Cynthidos, one Scruple: Salt Gemm, half a Scruple, mix them and make a Suppoſitory.</hi> It is not amiſſe, if after all this you purge the noxious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, mixing with your purge Narcoticks: See <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtus</hi> his Medicine preſcribed in the aforenamed Chap.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115825:113"/> Or give an Ounce and an half of Manna; of Oyl of Sweet Almonds newly drawn, two Ounces; give it in Broth. Then you muſt foment, bathe, or anoint the Belly, (See the aforeſaid 41 Chap.) The Bowels of a Wolf pulverized, and the white Dung of the ſame, is much commended, if the Patient take a Drachm in white Wine. The Electuary of Bay berries taken, as much as a Nutmeg often, eaſeth Pain. This Medicine I have uſed with good Succeſſe: <hi>Take of Pellitory of the Wall, Mints, Parſlypearch, of each, one handfull: the Roots of Fennel, Parſley, Marſhmallows, and Butchers Broom, of each half a handfull: Juniper Berries, one Ounce: the Seeds of Aunis, ſweet Fennel, and Cummis, of each, half an Ounce: Bay berries, three Drachms: bruize, ſlice, and powder them; Infuſe them in white wine twenty four houres, and distill it in Balneo:</hi> after ſufficient Evacuations, give one Ounce. <hi>Galen</hi> much commendeth the Application of a Cupping-glaſſe to the Navil; afterwards apply a Plaiſter of Tacamaha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha. Alſo the Decoction of Guajacum given for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes, is good, and afterwards purge Phlegm, if there be occaſion. The cholerick Chollick is cured alſo by giving of emollient Cliſters, and ſuch as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the Acrimony of the Humours: as the Decoction of Camomil, Violet leaves, Endive: the Seeds of Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nugreek, Linſeed, Hens-greaſe, Gooſe-greaſe, Oyl of Roſes, Ceſſia, and the like.

Cool the Liver outwardly by Epithems, and inwardly by Juleps, made of Poppy, Lettice, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory, Endive, Sorrel, Violets, and the like: forget not to add a little ſpirit of Vitriol to your Juleps.

                  </gap>, which ſignifieth <hi>to be rowled or girt about,</hi> and therefore the Latines call it <hi>Volvulus</hi> or <hi>Convolvulus.</hi> It is a praepoſterous moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Inteſtines, the Guts are obſtructed, nothing paſſeth downward, ſometimes the Excrements are brought up into the Stomach, and iſſue out at the Mouth. The Inteſtines have a natural Motion down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which is compared to the Motion of Earth-Worms, which move the parts of their Bodyes ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; by which they carry the Faeces and Excrements downwards. The expulſive Faculty of the Guts is ſometimes too vehemently ſtirred up, the Paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſtructed, that by a violent motion, the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious Matter is caſt upwards: ſo that not onely the Chylus and Excrements, but alſo Cliſters and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitoryes are violently ſnatched up and vomited. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which cauſeth the obſtruction of the Guts, as hard Dung long retained, groſſe Vapours, Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, Tumours, or the like, may be the Cauſe of this Diſeaſe. Sometimes an Ulcer in the Guts may be the Cauſe, when the Excrements touch the part ulcerated, it pricketh it, ſo that the Faculty is provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115825:114"/> not to let ſo noxious a thing paſſe, but driveth it upwards, the other Guts by Sympathy aſſiſting, forceth it into the Stomach, which alſo by a Periſtatick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Motion, caſteth it out by Vomit. The Diag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks of this Diſeaſe, are, partly common to thoſe of the Chollick, and partly proper or peculiar to it ſelf. Common Signes are, the Belly bound, and puffed up, Pain in the Abdomen, loathing, vomiting, difficulty of Breathing and Piſſing, want of Reſt. The pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Signes are, a violent Pain, great Diſtenſion, a hard Tumor in the Hypogaſtrium, nothing voided downwards, an irregular vomiting of Choller, Phlegm and Chylus, at laſt the Excrements are vomited up. The Signes of the cauſes are thus gathered, If Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the parts cauſe the Diſeaſe, it quickly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the height, an intenſe Feaver, with vomiting, as aforeſaid. If hard Dung in the Bowels be the Cauſe, there went before Conſtriction of the Belly, it is of longer Continuance, the Pain not ſo violent at firſt, nor the Feaver ſo great, if any. If Wind or Phlegm be the Cauſe, (for the moſt part) the Chollick prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the Signes thereof are laid down in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Chapter. This Diſeaſe is dangerous more or leſſe, according to the Cauſes and Symptoms; that which is accompanied with the Strangury, or that ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular vomiting before mentioned, (for the moſt part) is deadly. If there be a remiſſion of Symptoms, and things, taken at the mouth, find paſſage downwards, there is hopes of recovery.</p>
               <p>What belongs to the cure of this Diſeaſe, muſt thus be conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> If hard Dung obſtruct the paſſage, you muſt often inject emollient and laxative Cliſters, in the mean time, give Medicines inwardly of the ſame Nature, mixing with them ſuch as ſtrengthen the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Vital parts: having read thus fair you cannot
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115825:115"/> be ignorant how to prepare them: by this means I cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one in this Condition, who went not to Stool in ſixteen or eighteen dayes. You may likewiſe apply Fomentations, Liniments, and Cataplaſms of an emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient Nature to the Belly. If you find the Body fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and in much pain, adminiſter the Medicines pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed againſt the Chollick. If the Guts be inflamed, you muſt open a Vein, and draw as much Blood, as the ſtrength of the Sick will bear. Adminiſter cooling and emollient Cliſters, and other Medicines, preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, in the 42 Chapter, for the inflammation of the Stomach. If he vomit not, give him warm Water and Oyl of Violets, for it is a good Revulſion. Let his drink be Barly Water, and ſometimes give, in a draught thereof, two ounces of Oyl of ſweet Almonds, and, if the Pain be violent, uſe Narcoticks. Let him abſtain from Food, for it turns to no good Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: let him now and then take a ſpoonful of Broth, and drink ſuch things as are before mentioned. If the Bowels fall into the Cods, and cauſe this Diſeaſe, you muſt foment the part with emollient Oyls, and relaxing Decoctions, giving emollient and carminative Cliſters, then let the Patient ly with his Heels higher then his head, and gently thruſt them back, and keep them up with a Truſſe. If there be a Circumvolution of Hoiſting of the Guts, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> preſcribeth this as the laſt Remedy, namely, to apply a payr of Bellows to the Fundament, and blow into the Belly, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to give an emollient Cliſter; this hath been proved by many able Phyſitians, and highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

This Diſeaſe is not to be referred to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction-hurt onely, but to the Debility of the retentive Faculty, for the Meat is not long enough receined to be concocted; hence it appeareth, that the Diſeaſe cometh from a fault of the Stomach as well as the Guts. The Cauſes of this Diſeaſe are referred to three Heads; Firſt, a cold Diſtemper of the Stomach and Liver, which generateth flegmatick and gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Humours, which cover the wrinkles of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, that it cannot retain the Food. Though Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention be made by the aſtringing Quality, yet it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates by fit Inſtruments, <hi>viz.</hi> the Roughneſſe of the inward Coat of the Stomach, which Roughneſſe being taken away, and the wrinklesfilled up by the Humours aforeſaid, the Retention is hurt, and the Meat ſlippeth away without Concoction. Secondly, ſharp Humours prick and twitch the parts, by which the Stomach and Guts are provoked to ſend forth the Meat too ſoon. Laſtly, in malignant Feavers, and other dangerous Diſeaſes, the retentive Faculty is weakned, and Nature being conquered degenerateth into a Lientery. There is another Cauſe, peculiar to the Coeliack Paſſion, Namely, the Obſtruction of the Meſeraick Veins,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115825:116"/> which hinder the paſſage of the Chilus to the Liver, and therefore muſt of neceſſity be caſt forth by the Belly. I need not lay down the Signes of this Diſeaſe, being obvious to the Eye. The Cauſes may be thus diſcovered. If it come from a cold Diſtemper, there are ſowr Belchings, the Excrements are phlegmatick: If the Humours flow from the Head, the Excrements are frothy, and the Flux greater after Sleep, the Signes of a Catarrh appear. If it come from Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, there is a Heat in the Hypocondria, ſharp and cholerick Excrements, great Thuſt, and a Gnawing in the Stomach. Theſe Diſeaſes if they laſt long are very dangerous, becauſe Nature is deprived of her Nouriſhment, and the Body ſoon falleth into a Dropſy or Atrophy. If it follow other Diſeaſes, it is for the moſt part deadly. If the Diſeaſe hath its originall from phlegmatick Humours, covering the wrinkles of the Stomach, you muſt uſe thoſe remedyes, propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the cure of Want of Appetite comming from a cold Cauſe, with which, make uſe of thoſe things which are aſtringent to ſtay the Flux. Cliſters are of no great force, except the Flux be violent, in ſuch Caſes they muſt be aſtringent, ſuch as ſhall be preſcribed in the 47 Chapter, of the Flux Dyſentery. You muſt purge the peccant Humours, and then ſtrengthen the Stomach, with the Medicines preſcribed in the Cure of Want of Appetite; for which purpoſe <hi>Amatus Luſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> highly commendeth this following Opiate: <hi>Take of Conſerve of Roſes, ſix Ounces: of the beſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſix Drachms: Sirrup of Quinces, ſufficient to make an Opiate:</hi> give half an Ounce in the Morning, and faſt one hour. If this Flux come from Provocation by cholerick Humours, do as you are taught in the Chapter of cholerick Vomiting, or you may uſe thoſe things preſcribed in the following Chapter of the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115825:116"/> Flux Diarrhaea. For that which comes from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity of the retentive Faculty, now and then give Cliſters made of Poſſet drink, in which red Roſes have been boiled, and diſſolve Sugar therein, and the yelks of Eggs.

If the Humours come from the Liver, they are chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, and there appeareth ſome Diſtemper of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. If from the Spleen, the Excrements are black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and diſtempers of the Spleen and Hypocondria ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. If from the Meſentery, there is extention; but Humours there, have their original from the Liver or Spleen. If from the Womb, there are the Symptoms of the Womb affected.</p>
               <p>To the Prognoſtick: I ſay, the Flux of the Belly, which is Critical, that is eaſily endured, and is a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Patient, by which, Humours, which are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome to Nature, are diſcharged, is good. On the contrary, if it be ſymptomatical, painful, &amp; weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Nature, it is evil. If the Excrements are thin, voided often, with Pain, without Feeling when
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115825:117"/> they are voided, or in an acute Diſeaſe, all theſe are evil Signes. If the Excrements voided be yellow as yelks of Eggs, green, black blew, or of divers colours, it is evil. If this Flux afflict a Woman with Child, ſhe is in great danger of Miſcariage. If the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments begin to grow thicker, there is hopes of Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. If a Flux happeneth in the Dropſy, wherein the whole Body is affected, it cauſeth a Recovery: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this where the Patient is young, ſtrong, and the Diſeaſe but begun; for if Nature be weakned by the long continuance of the Diſeaſe, and the Flux happen, the Diſeaſe and Life (hand in hand) go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>For the Cure, If the Body abound with Blood, open a Vein; if not, if the Patient hath a Feaver, it is good to let Blood. Then purge the Humour offending, with ſuch Purgers, that leave an Aſtringent behind them: If the Body be ſtrong, vointing is good, for it revelleth and evacuateth the Matter of the Diſeaſe. Before and after purging, give cleanſing Cliſters; after the Body is ſufficiently emptied, give aſtringent; all which the next Chapter will furniſh you with. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly you may give aſtringent und ſtrengthning Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, preſcribed in the next Chapter; If your Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent be free from a Feaver, boil new milk and ſcum off the Foam, and quench red hot Steel often in it, and let him drink thereof warm, which is a preſent Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Unripe Mulberryes, and Blackberryes dryed and heaten to powder, is good to ſtay this Flux. This O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate is excellent: <hi>Take of the juyce of Quinces, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Roſes, of each, one Ounce: Sanguis Draconis, Terra Sigillata, and fine Bole, of each, one Drachm: Bloodſtone, and the Troches of Amber, of each, half a Drachm; with Sirrup of Comphrey, make an Opiate,</hi> and let the Patient take a little often. <hi>Take of the Powder
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115825:118"/> of Rubarb, one Ounce; the Troches of Sanders, two Drachms, mix it,</hi> and give the Patient two Drachms twice a day; it evacuateth the Matter and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Bowels. Both the Sirrup, Magiſtery, and Tincture of Coral availeth much; and the Decoction of Juniper Berryes in red Wine is no leſſe effectual. If it continue long, and your Patient's ſtrength much decay, give Laudanum among your other Medicines. The Fume of Fleabane and Mullein taken through a hollow Chair is excellent. The Conſerve of Hips is good againſt a cholerick Flux, you may mix with it ſuch things, which are aſtringent: I ſhall ſay no more of the Cure of this Diſeaſe, but refer you to the next Chapter. Onely this, if the Diſeaſe come by conſent of other parts, ſeek the Cure in their proper Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

                  </gap> is a bloody Looſeneſſe of the Belly, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon the Ulceration of the Inteſtines: but it is commonly taken for every Bloody Flux: the Latines call it <hi>Tormina,</hi> becauſe of the Torture the Patient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth. <hi>Galen</hi> mentioneth four kinds of Fluxes, which he calleth Dyſenteries. The firſt is, when any uſual Evacuation of Blood, as the Haemorrhoids, or at the Noſe, is omitted or impedited, or any part of the body is hurt, and by that means the Blood is ſent to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, and voided by the Belly. The ſecond is, when watry Blood is voided, by reaſon of the weakneſs of the of the Liver; of this I ſhall treat hereafter. The third is,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115825:118"/> when Blood mixed with Melancholy, and burnt by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of long Retention in the Liver and Spleen, is evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and ſhineth. The laſt, and that which I am now to diſcourſe on, is, when Blood and Excrements are mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and ſometimes alſo Matter is mixed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and is evacuated with Torture to the Patient, by reaſon of Ulceration in the Guts; this is the proper Dyſentery. The internal Cauſes, are ſharp and ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Humours, yellow, green, and black Choller: Salt Phlegm in the Head, bred by Heat, or in the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by putrefaction, which being brought to the Guts and ſticking to them ulcerateth the part. The Cauſes external, are all things which make ſharp and evil Humours, Meats which ſoon putrify, Fruits which are ſoon rotten, all things unripe; the Air thus qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the Winter cold and dry, and the Spring very wet and ful of South Winds, cauſe Dyſenteryes in the Summer: Or if the Winter be wet and full of South Winds, and a dry Spring and the North Winds blow much; ſuch a Seaſon produceth Dyſenteryes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Air is infected, and produceth a contagious and epidemical Dyſentery, which is ſo infectious, that the Excrements of the Sick, being caſt into a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, infecteth all that ſit over it. The Diagnoſtick Signes are, often and bloody Evacuations, with Pain in the Belly, Watching, Thirſting, Loathing of Meat, ſometimes a Feaver. If the ſmall Guts are affected, the Pain is vehement like the pricking of Pins, becauſe they are of more exquiſite Senſe, they go not to Stool preſently after the Pain, and the Blood is mixed with the Excrements. The contrary judge, if it be in the great Guts, the Pain not ſo ſharp, they go to Stool preſently after, and the Blood ſwimmeth on the top of, or a little mixed with, the Excrements. You may judge of the Humour cauſing this Diſeaſe, by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115825:119"/> of the Excrements, Age and Temperament of the Patient, and Seaſon of the year. Thus the Prognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks are made. Dyſenteryes cauſed by black Choller are deadly, if it be not Critical, becauſe the Ulcer groweth cancerous: be ſure you judg aright between Melancholy and Blood congealed. If Loathing of Meat and a Feaver accompany it, it is dangerous. If pieces of Fleſh be voided, it is deadly. Much Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, great Thirſt, black, bloody, and ſtinking Stools without a Mixture of Humours, Hiccough, cholerick Vomitings, Pain in the Liver and Midriff, are (for the moſt part) deadly Signes. If Choler or ſharp Diet be the cauſe of this Diſeaſe, it is eaſily cured; ſalt-Phlegm is worſe, becauſe it ſticks longer to the Guts. If this Diſeaſe happen to one troubled with a diſeaſe in the Spleen, or the Gout, it is good (ſaith <hi>Hippocrates</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Matter is ſent forth: but this is rather a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arrhae a then a Dyſentery.</p>
               <p>To cure, you muſt evacuate ſharp Humours, you muſt aſſwage Pain, cleanſe, conſolidate, and dry the Ulcer, and ſtop the Flux. To evacuate the Humours, you muſt purge every ſecond, third, or fourth day, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Patients Age, Strength, Seaſon of the year, and the like. Rubarb is exceeding good in this Diſeaſe, given a Drachm, or a Drachm and an half, or two Drachms; Or made into a Potion thus: <hi>Take of Liquoriſh ſcraped and ſliced, and Raiſons of the Sun, of each, three Drachms: Tamarinds and yellow Myrabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans, of each, two Drachms: boil them in Barly and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane water to three Ounces: in which streined, infuſe a Drachm of Rubarb thin ſliced: then add one Ounce of the Sirrup of Roſes ſolutive, and make a Potion:</hi> if you think it not ſtrong enough, add of Diacatholicon, three Drachms; or you may give the Rubarb in Powder, in the aforeſaid Decoction. If the Dyſentery be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115825:119"/> with a Feaver, and Inflammation of the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, open a Vein, and let the Patient bleed according to his Strength. Sometimes vomiting is profitable to revell the Humours, which fall from the Stomach to the Inteſtines; Omit not vomiting if you find the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach very foul: Eſpecially if the Sick be inclinable to vomit, for then Nature dictates the right way, and ought to be imitated. In the mean while, you muſt give aſſwaging, mild, and cleanſing Cliſters, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards glutinous and aſtringent, Thus: <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſhmallows, Butter-burr, of each, one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: Camomil Flowers, one Pugil: the Seeds of Flax, and Fleabane, of each, two Drachms; boil them in Barly water, or Milk Chalybeated, or Mutton, Capon, or Sheeps Head Broth, to a Pint; strain it, and diſſolve therein the yolks of four Eggs well beaten, Oyl of Roſes, and Sirrup of Quinces, of each, one Ounce; and make a Clister.</hi> If the Ulcer want cleanſing, add Century and Wormwood to the former Decoction: and to the ſtrained Liquor add Turpentine diſſolved in the yolk of an Egg, &amp; the chymical Oyl of Wax, of each, one Drachm. When there is need of more binding and glutinating, make a Cliſter thus: <hi>Take of the Roots of Comphry, Tormentill, and Bistort, of each, one Ounce: Plantane, Shepherds purſe, Knot-graſſe, and Mouſ-ear, of each, one handfull: Pomegranate Flowers, Mirtles, Acorn cups, and Cypreſſe Nuts, of each, one Drachm: parched Rice, French Barly, and red Roſes, of each, one Pugill: Make a Decoction in Smiths water, to a Pint of the straining; add of the Juyce of Plantane and Yarrow, of each, one Ounce, and the yolks of two roaſted Eggs.</hi> Or, inſteed of the Juyces, you may add the Muſilage of Gum Traganth, made with Roſe or Plantane Water, and the Suet of a Goat, of each, one Drachm, which Emplaſtick Cliſters, as with a Plaiſter, cover the internal Superficies of the Guts,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115825:120"/> and preſerveth the part from the gnawing of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. All this while you muſt give internal Medicines of the ſame Nature, and the oftner, if the upper Guts are ulcerated. Firſt, to cleanſe, give Gears Milk; to glutinate, Cows Milk Chalybiated; with it, you may mix the juyce of Plantane, Sirrup of Comphry, Sugar of Roſes, the Troches of Amber, and the white Troches of Rhaſis. Let the Sick eat Rice boiled in Chalybia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Milk: or the Muſilage of Gum Traganth and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick, drawn as before, in his Broth half a Drachm. The Body being well cleanſed, you may make an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent Decoction to compleat the Cure: <hi>Take of the Roots of Biſtort, Tormentill, and Comphry, the Leaves of Plantane, Yarrow, Shepherds purſe, Horſe-tayl, Mouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ear, and Agrimony, of each, one handfull: the Seeds of Sorrel, Sumach, and Grape-ſtones, of each, one Ounce. make a Decoction in four quarts of Water, to the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of half; Sweeten the strained Liquor with the Sirrup of Comphry, Quinces, dryed Roſes, Myrtles, or Corall.</hi> Front what hath been ſaid, there is light enough for the Ingenious to make Medicines in any form, to pleaſe the Pallate of his Patient, which I omit, being loath to be tedious; but leſt I ſhould omit any thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, make an Opiate thus: <hi>Take of Conſerve of Roſes, and Quinces, of each, one Ounce: Conſerve of Comphry Roots, half an Ounce: Coral prepared, Sanguis Draconis, Bolearmenick, ſealed Earth, Acatia, Conſerve of Sloes, of each, one Drachm: burnt Ivory and Spodium, of each, one Scruple, with any of the Sirrups aforeſaid, ſufficient to make an Opiate,</hi> and give the Quantity of a Cheſnut, Morning, Night, and Noon.</p>
               <p>Narcoticks do Wonders, eſpecially, if they be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with aſtringents, and ſtrengthners: <hi>Take of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Roſes and Services, of each, one Drachm: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio Alchermes half a Scruple: Laudanum three Grains,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115825:120"/> make a Bolus.</hi> Anoint the Belly with the Oyls of Quinces, Myrtles, Roſes, Maſtich, Wormwood, and the like. The Oyntment called <hi>Comitiſſae</hi> is of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Virtue. I might here teach you to make Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations and Cataplaſms, for the purpoſe aforeſaid, of the aforenamed Simples, but ſeeing the Ingenious need it not, and the Ignorant deſerve it not, I ſhall ſave that labour, fearing my Booke will ſwell to a greater Volume then I intended. What ever you do, remember to ſtrengthen the Liver, with Cataplaſms for that purpoſe, made of Simples ſtrengthning the Liver. If the Dyſentery be Epidemical, and Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; Sudorifick Medicines are of great force. As Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines made of Bezoar, and Treacle water: you muſt begin with Cordials, and proceed as you do in a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Feaver.</p>

For the Knowledg of this Diſeaſe, it is eaſy to diſtinguiſh between this and a Dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entery.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115825:121"/> In a Tenaſmus, the deſire of going to Stool is continual; in the Dyſentery, by Fits onely. In the firſt (notwithſtanding all ſtraining) nothing is voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but Slime, bloody or mattery; in the other, both Exerements and Humours are voided. (The Signes of the Cauſes ſeek in the former Chapter.) Tenaſmus (for the moſt part) is eaſily cured, but is dangerous, if a melancholy Humour be the Cauſe, leſt it turn to an ulcerated Cancer; yet (for the moſt part) it is of long Continuance, and very troubleſome. If a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with Child hath the Tenaſmus, it brings many Inconveniences to her, and great danger of Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, ſhe will miſcarry; but I have known the contrary. True it is, a Woman ſeldom eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capeth in that condition, for that Motion doth much diſturb the Womb; becauſe the ſame Muſcles which ſerve to caſt forth the Excrements, are employed for Delivery. If the Ulcer be near the Fundament or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> if it continue long, it turns to an incurable Fiſtula. For the Cure I ſhall refer you to the former Chapter, it being the ſame, both in the Cauſes, and the part affected, of the ſame Nature with the other Inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</p>

                  <hi>FLuxus Hepaticus,</hi> a Flux of the Liver is, when ſerous and bloody Humours are voided, much like Water wherein Fleſh hath been waſhed. It is cauſed by an evil Diſpoſition, conſuming the radical Moiſture of the Liver, and deſtroyeth the natural Heat thereof; this
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115825:121"/> Diſpoſition cometh by burning and ſwooning Feavers, &amp; by a hot Diſtemper of the Bowels: or by great Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from abundance of Phlegm and Melancholy, which oppreſſeth the natural Heat.</p>
               <p>Outward Cauſes, as great draughts of cold Water, extraordinary eating of raw Sallets, poyſonous and too violent Purges, ſalt, ſharp, and peppered Meats, which parch the Subſtance of the Liver, may corrupt the natural Hear. There is alſo a baſtard Flux of the Liver, when the radical Moiſture is not in fault, nor the Faculty hurt, yet the Blood is impure and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, by the mixture of Choller, Melancholy, or ſome corrupt Matter: or by its ſtaying too long in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the parts adjacent: by which it is made thick, burnt or rotten: or the Spleen is in fault, and doth not ſuck away the droſſy Blood. In this Baſtard Fluy, thick and black Blood, and ſometimes Blood mixed with divers Humours, is voided. The Signes of this Diſeaſe may be gathered from what hath been ſaid, and it differeth from the Dyſentery in this, that the Stools are l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>quid, bloody, and watry, and voided without pain. The Signes of the Cauſes moſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. If this defect of the Liver come from a hoe Diſtemper, there went before a burning Feaver, or a Feaver is preſent, green Vomits or Stcols, Thirſt, Foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Body, and Want of Appetite, ſtinking Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations. If from cold, the Stools are not ſo ſtinking, nor is there Thirſt; the whoſe Body is colder and blewiſh. Moiſt and dry Cauſes produce contrary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; a moiſt Diſtemper cauſeth more Stools and thin: a dry, ſewer and thicker, and leſſe in Quantity, with much Thirſt. This Diſeaſe is very dangerous, becauſe a principal part is affected, and the radical Moiſture conſumed, which can ſcarcely be reſtored, and nothing but deſtruction to be hoped for; ſo much the more if
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115825:122"/> the Diſeaſe comes of Hear. If it comes in Feavers, the whole Body melteth and putrifieth. If it come from a cold Cauſe, it loſteth the longer, and turns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an incurable Dropſy. Though a Baſtard-Flux of the Liver be dangerous, yet it is farr leſſe then a true one: becauſe the Liver is ſound, and the Diſtemper may be taken away, if the Humours which corrupt the Blood be evacuated. In the Cure of this Diſeaſe, your main work is to ſtrengthen the Liver, correct the Diſtemper, and ſtay the Flux. If it come from a cold Cauſe, deal with it as with a Dropſy. But if it come of a hot Cauſe (as for the moſt part it doth,) you may gently evacuate the peccant Humours with Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, as you are taught in the Cure of the Dyſentery. Then you muſt give Medicines, which ſtrengthen the Liver: <hi>Take of the Roots of Succory, Sorrell, Bloodwort, and Monks-Rubath, of each, one Ounce: the Leaves of Plantane, Endive, Succory, Purſlane, Agrimeny, and Dandelion, of each, one handfull: Wormwood, half a handfull: Red Sanders, two Drachms: Coriander ſeeds prepared, a Drachm: red Roſes, one Pugill, the ſhavings of Ivory and Spodium, of each, a Drachm: boil them in Barly water to a Quart, and in the ſtraining, diſſolve, of the Sirrups of Quinces, Vinegar Simple, and dried Roſes, of each, two Ounces; of the Oyl of Vitriol, as much as will make it moderately ſharp; and make a Julep for ſix Doſes, to be given Morning and Evening, Firſt and Laſt.</hi> The Sirrup of Myrtles, of Succory ſimple, or compound with Rubarb, the Sirrup, Tincture, or Magiſtery of Pearl is very good, and may be made uſe of as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or made into a Julep with Plantane, or other cooling Waters. The Liver of a Wolf is much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and it may be made into an Electuary, Opiate, or into any other form, with the aforenamed ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. The Tops of young Nettles boiled in Broth or
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115825:122"/> Water are good, and the juyce taken is more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſtop the Flux and to purify the Blood. It is good to apply an Epitheme to the Region of the Liver, made of the aforenamed Ingredients, or as many of them as you think good. It is convenient that, among your Medicines, which you give to ſtop the Flux, you adminiſter ſuch as are reſtorative, becauſe in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe the Body is much conſumed. <hi>Riverius</hi> much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth this diſtilled Water, and the truth is, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth commendation: <hi>Take a fat Capon and a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge; pull and draw them, and filth ir bellyes with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory, Agrimony, and Snails, of each, one Handfull: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Roſes, three Ounces: Plantane and Coriander Seeds prepared, of each, two Drachms: Citron Myrabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans, one Drachm: the Leavs of Bloodwort, half a handfull: the Troches of Amber and Spodium, of each, four Scruples: the Powder of the Electuary de Gemmis, Triaſantalon, and Diamargariton frigidum, of each, one Drachm: Sprinkle them with Styptick Wine, and put them into the Fowls Bellyes: boil them in a cloſe Veſſel, in four Pints of Water, till half be conſumed; then put them into a glaſſe Limbeck with three Ounces of good Wine, and distill them in Balaeo:</hi> give a little of the Water often by it ſelf, or with other Medicines.</p>

               <p>VVorms (for the moſt part) breed in the Guts, therefore I ſhall ſpeak of them here. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> Propounds three kinds of Worms; the Firſt, are round and long, and are called <hi>Teretes,</hi> and are more
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115825:123"/> common then the reſt, and are bred in the Guts, but do ſomtimes get up into the Stomach. The Second are called <hi>Aſcarides,</hi> they are little and ſmal, like threds, and they commonly ly in the lower part of the thick Inteſtines, and over againſt the Sphincter-Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: The third ſort are broad Worms and long, though ſeldome ſeen: ſometimes they are voided of an incredible length. They are bred of ſuch Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment as eaſily putrifieth in the Stomach: hence it cometh to paſſe that Children, and ſuch as are glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, who eat much Fruit and ſuch things as eaſily putrify, eſpecially more being eaten, before the former is digeſted, are troubled with Worms. The Signes of Worms in the Guts are divers, not in all alike: a ſtinking and ſowr Breath, Stools like Cow dung; in colour, Gray like Potters earth. Sometimes there is a continual Feaver, Heavineſſe, Fainting, Loathing, Vomiting, unquenchable Thirſt, and ſometimes cold Sweats: an unequal Pulſe, the Cheeks are, ſometimes red, ſometimes blew, the Eyes ſhine, the Noſe itcheth, the Teeth gnaſh, a dry Cough. There is pain in the Belly, ſometimes by Inflammation, and ſometimes by Diſtention, ſome ſtart in their Sleep. Sometimes the Body pineth, and the Patient hath an inſatiable Appetite, this is a Signe of flat Worms, which eat up the Food. The <hi>Aſcarides</hi> are known by the itching of the Fundament, and the Excrements are many times full of them. Sometimes the eating away of the Gums is a Signe of Worms. Though to Children and older Folk Worms are common, and little feared, yet many and dangerous Symptoms and Diſeaſes are bred by them. In the beginning of a Diſeaſe, it is evil for Worms to be voided alive or dead, eſpecially alone without Dung: if they be alive, they ſignify great Crudity, and Want of Nouriſhment; if dead, great
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115825:123"/> Putrefaction, by which they are killed. In the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Diſeaſe, Worms comming forth with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, is a good Signe. The Cure of the Worms conſiſteth in giving Medicines to kill them, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuate them being killed. The beſt way to kill them, or at leaſt to drive them to the lower Inteſtines, are theſe Simples which follow, <hi>viz.</hi> all the ſorts of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Southernwood, Calamint, Dogs-tooth, Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Horehound, Dittany, Hyſſop, Rew, Savin, Peach leavs, Coriander ſeed, Harts horn, Lupines, Mints, Garlick, Elecampane, and many other: of theſe Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples may ſeveral forms of Medicines be compoſed, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them ſuch things as purge, not onely to kill, but alſo to carry away the Cauſe of Worms; Rubarb is much commended, becauſe it may ſafely be given, if a Feaver be preſent. <hi>Take of Rubarb, one Drachm, yellow Sanders, half a Scruple; infuſe them, in Purſlane water, three Ounces, ſtrain them, and diſſolve the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Rubarb, and the Powder againſt the Worms (which you may have at the Apothecaryes) of each, one Scruple, Sirrup of Roſes, one Ounce; mix them, and make a Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> If the Feaver be not great, add Hiera picra to your Potion, more or leſſe according to the ſtrength of your Patient, afterwards give a Cliſter, made of the Decoction of Liquoriſh, Raiſons, Figs; or Chicken Broth ſweetned with Sugar and Hony of Roſes; ſuch Cliſters are good to draw them down into the thick Guts. Afterwards give a Cliſter made after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>Take of Wormwood, Southernwood, Century, of each, one handfull: Lupines, half an Ounce: the Seed of Wormwood, and Coriander ſeed prepared, of each, two Drachms: In a half Pint or a Pint of the ſtrained Liquor, (according umo the age of the Patient) diſſolve one Ounce or two of the Oyl of Wormwood, and Salt, one Drachm and an half.</hi> To bring them out being killed,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115825:124"/> add to the former Cliſter, Benedicta Laxativa, Hiera picra, and Caſſia newly drawn, of each, three Drachms, or more if your Patient can bear it. <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doleitus</hi> doth highly commend Diaearthamum; and the Infuſion of Agarick in Oxymel, becauſe it not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly killeth Worms, but purgeth Phlegm and corrupted Chyle, of which, Worms breed and are nouriſhed: but this remember, they are not proper Remedies in Feavers. Therefore, if the Sick hath a Feaver, you muſt be careful how you adminiſter hot Medicines, the like you muſt obſerve, if you adminiſter any thing to people of hot Natures. Women do commonly give Wormſeed to their Children for the Worms, mixed with ſweet things, which is a Medicine not to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed. But, leaſt it ſhould hurt by its Hear, infuſe it two hours in Vinegar, afterwards mix it with boyled Hony, and make an Opiate, which <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> much commendeth. <hi>Forrestus</hi> as highly commendeth burnt Harts-horn given with Raiſons. Aloes are much in uſe likewiſe, but the Pill de Aloe roſata is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if half a Drachm be given at Night. The Juyce of Lemmons is good, (if there be a Feaver) and a good corrigent for hotter Medicines. If they have not a Feaver, the Chymical Oyl of Juniper given one drop in Broth is excellent: and no leſſe effectual is ſpring Water, made ſharp with Oyl of Vitriol. Many (and thoſe very learned) Phyſitians have much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Quickſilver, who ſay it may be taken in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate quantity with admirable ſucceſſe, and without the leaſt danger to the Body: for <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſaith, that it killeth no otherwiſe, but by tearing the Guts with its great weight; therefore we fear not to give it in a ſmall Quantity, becauſe its Weight and Roundneſſe will eaſily carry it through the Body. Of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo was <hi>Mathiolus, Braſſavolus, Fallovius, Platerus,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115825:124"/> Fabricius, Hildanus, John Baptiſta Zappata, Baricellus' Sanctorius,</hi> and many others, who extol the benefit of this Medicine to the heavens for its Virtue, and ſay they never found any inconvenience by it. Thoſe that dread the uſe of that, let them uſe <hi>Mercurius Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> well prepared; the Doſe for once taking, is from eight to ten Grains, for a Boy of ten years of Age; it will be better if you mix, of Diagridium, half the weight of the former, to carry it ſooner out of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to expel the Worms, if you give it to a child yonger, or to a weak Child, give it in a ſmaller quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. Laſtly, you may make Topicks, of what form you pleaſe, to apply to the Belly: <hi>Take of the Oyls of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Mints, and bitter Almonds, of each, one Ounce: the Juyce of Wormwood and Rue, of each, two Ounces: Wormſeed, Aloes, and Elicampane in powder, of each, a Drachm: Colloquintida, ſix Drachms: of the Gall of an Ox, two or three Ounces, with Wax, ſufficient to make an Unguent,</hi> or ſo much (if you pleaſe) as will make a Plaiſter, and apply it; if the Sick be looſe, leave out the Colloquintida.</p>

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115825:125"/> and Liver, an Arrophy, Cachexia, and Dropſy for want of natural Heat, for by this Flux the Blood is waſted, which is the Treaſure of life, and Cheriſher of the whole Body. This Flux hath the ſame Cauſe that other bleedings have, <hi>viz.</hi> Blood offending in Quantity or Quality. In Quantity, when plenty of Blood it brought to the Haemorrhoid Veins, and dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and openeth the Orifices, or overmaſtereth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Faculty, hence followeth a Flux. If the Blood offend in Quality, as Sharpneſſe and Thinneſſe, it ſtirrs up the expulſive Faculty, and ſendeth forth both good and bad Blood. This Diſeaſe is known by weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and a yellowiſh Colour of the Body, comming upon a long Flux of the Haemorrhoids. If too much Blood be the Cauſe of the Flux, there went before, Cauſes of encreaſe of Blood; and the beginning of the Flux was a refreſhment to the Patient; but the Flux continuing, he grows weak. If the Flux came from Sharpneſſe and Thinneſſe of the Blood, there prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Cauſes which breed Choller, or ſharp Water, the Body is of a cholerick Conſtitution, the Blood floweth violently and is ſhining, whereas if it offend onely in Quantity, it is black and Melancholy. To perform the Cure, you muſt ſtanch or moderate the Blood, by revelling, deriving, thickning, and aſtringing Means. Firſt, open a Vein in the Arm, and if the Patient hath not loſt much Blood, but aboundeth therewith, draw Blood plentifully; otherwiſe, draw little and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Rub and bind the ſuperior parts, and Cup and Scarify the Shoulders that the Blood may be revelled. By gentle Purges, derive the cholerick Humours, which make the Blood ſo violent: purge with ſuch things as have an aſtringent Quality, as Rubarb, Myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolans, Tamarinds, ſuch as are preſcribed againſt vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Blood, and bleeding at the Noſe. But beware
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115825:125"/> leſt the Body be too much bound, leſt by ſtraining, the Veins will be more open: therefore after the uſe of aſtringents, let the Patient eat ſharp French Prunes before and after Meat. Then you muſt give ſuch things as may thicken the Blood, (have recourſe to the 19, 30 and 39 Chapters.) Laſtly, you muſt prepare aſtringent Fomentations and Unguents to be applyed to the Haemorreoid Veins: boil Mullein in Smith's water, and foment; or you may add other Herbs of the ſame Nature to it, thus: <hi>Take of the Roots of Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, half a Pound: the Leaves of Plantane, Mullein, Shepherds purſe, Bramble, and Oak Leavs, of each, two Handfulls: Pomegranate Flowers and Peels, Galls and Sumach berries, of each, one Handfull: red Roſes, two Pugills; Myrtles, half a Drachm: Allum, one Ounce, boil them in three parts of Smith's Water, and one of red Wine, and ſoment the part therewith,</hi> but let it be but moderately hot. Or with a greater quantity of the Simples, you may make a Bath for the Sick to ſit in, but let it not be hot. Or you may make an Ointment with their Juyces, and Bolearmenick. Terra Sigilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Sanguis Draconis, Ceruſe, Vinegar, and ſuch like; Unguentum Comitiſſae is good to anoint the Veins and the Back. The Dripping of un Eel is much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Or take the Hairs of an Hare burnt, Spiders Webs mixed with the white of an Egg, and apply it. Or touch the Vein with Oyl of Vitriol, and, in a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Caſe, with Aqua Fortis. If the Veins ſhould ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate, cleanſe the Ulcer as you are taught in divers places of this Treatiſe.

               <p>THe Haemorrhoid-Veins, ſometimes do ſwell and cauſe very great pain. The cauſe of this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not from the former, for the blood offending in quantity or quality, and cannot open the ends of the Veins, cauſeth a Tumor, or inflammation. Theſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are ſometimes like Grapes, Mulberries, Warts, and ſometimes like bladders: Some are externall, others internall. It is convenient that you make a diſtinction between the Haemorrhoids, and the clefts of the Fundament, which are like thoſe chops which are in the lips, cauſed by ſharp Northerly winds: and the Tumor called Condiloma, which is in colour, black, as the Haemorrhoids are, in form, long, and not in the Veins; whereas the Haemorrhoids are in the Veins, and round. There is alſo in the Fundament ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be found a carnuons ſwelling, called Thymi, and ſometimes in the privities of Men and Women, and they are like the flowers of Thyme, they are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, white, or reddiſh, without pain; the Haemorrhoids are for the moſt part black, greater, and painfull. The piles are greater then the former, they are called <hi>Fici,</hi> they are blew and painfull, are like the Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids, onely they are a carnuous ſwelling, and the Haemorrhoids is a ſwelling of the Veins. The Piles are of a Maligne quality, and do ſometimes ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate. The ſwelling of the Haemorrhoids is not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, unleſſe it be inflamed, and Gangrene: Or if it ſuppurate and come to an Ulcer, and chance to turn
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115825:126"/> to a Fiſtula, which may prove incurable. To cure, you muſt bleed, and make ſuch revulſions preſcribed in the former Chapter; likewiſe open the Saphaena. You muſt not uſe ſtrong purges, leſt you draw more humours to the place, yet you muſt keep the body ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble, leaſt the voiding of hard dung greatly encreaſe pain; keep the body ſoluble by this or the like Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine: <hi>Take of the leaves of Lettice, Burrage, Bugloſſe, and Mallows, of each, one handfull: Polypody of the Oak three ounces; Liquoriſh, Raiſons ſtoned, and Currant, of each, half an ounce: Bugloſſe, Burrage, and Violet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers, of each, one Pugill; Boil it in running water to a pint and an half; Strain it, and infuſe therein an Ounce of Senna, (the liquor being kept hot) ſix hours; then put in of Caſſia newly drawn, one ounce, and let it ſtand an hour; ſtrain it, and Clarify it, and ſweeten it with two ounces of ſyrrup of Violits,</hi> make four poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, and give it twice in a day, firſt and laſt. Then you muſt apply ſuch things to them which hath power to caſe pain, viz. the Oil of Peach-kernells, Sweet Almonds, Nuts, Egs, Box: or oils of the ſeeds of Poppy, or Henbane. Of theſe may divers Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be made, good to appeaſe pain, diſcuſs the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and to dry the Ulcers: <hi>Take of the oyl of Eggs, (made in a Leaden Morter) the oyl of Violets, and Roſes, of each one ounce; Populeon, half an Ounce, the Oyl of Box, two ſcruples, with Hens Greaſe, and Goats Suet, ſufficient to make a Liniment, and apply it, or take of the juice of Purſlane, and honey, of each, two ounces; white Diachylon, mollified with the Oyl of Chamomell, two Ounces, Opium, ſix grains; make an Unguent. Horſtius</hi> commendeth wild Flax made into an Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with Hogs greaſe. To diſcuſſe the Tumor, the Balſome of Sulphur is much commended, or this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſme is good. Take of Plantane, Pilewort, and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:115825:127"/> Mallows of each a like quantity; make a decoction in Milk, till the liquor be half waſted, ſtrain out the hearbs, and make a Cataplaſm with the crums of white bread; adding to it the Oyl of Violets, Roſes, Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and the like. Or a Cataplaſm made of the heads of Leeks, is much commended. Green Elder leaves boyled to ſlime, and applyed, and often renewed, are very good. The Lungs of a Sheep or Goat taken hot, and ſome ſlices thereof applyed, or if the ſick ſit upon them, it oftentimes proveth effectuall. If you ſee good, you may make a fomentation, with Mullein, Mallows, Marſhmallows, Pellitory of the Wall, Flax, and Fenugreek ſeed in Milk, water, or Oyl, or all of them; or with a great quantity make a Bath: Or a fume made of the powder of Darnell, Mullein, Pile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, dried and thrown upon hot coals, and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men received. The decoction of yarrow, Mullein, and Pilewort, is a good Medicine to take inwardly, or a Syrrup made of their Juyces, againſt both Haemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoids and Piles. If they will not open, bleed them with Leeches, or rub them till they bleed. If the Piles be ulcerated, the Balſom of Sulphur, the Oyl of Egs ſtirred in a Leaden Morter, is good to cleanſe them. To conclude, thoſe that are ſubject to theſe diſtempers, ought to have an Iſſue in the Leg.</p>

               <p>A Hot diſtemper of the Liver is either with, or without matter; but for the moſt part, a hot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the Liver, doth produce hot and cholerick humours: It is called in Greek <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; it is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed either by hot weather, violent exerciſe, anger, or ſuch like paſſions of the mind: hot or ſpiced nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, drinking much Wine, or any thing that is naturally hot. This diſtemper is known by loathing of meat, the body Coſtive and hot, eſpecially the palms of the hands, and ſoles of the feet, the whole body groweth lean; a bitterneſſe of the mouth, and for the moſt part a Feaver; if there be plenty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, the patient vomiteth, or evacuateth down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Choller; he is the worſe for hot, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for cold things. This diſtemper, though not very dangerous in it ſolf, yet may be the cauſe of many diſeaſes: It is hard to cure it if the ſtomach be cold, becauſe what you give to cool the Liver, increaſeth the diſtemper of the ſtomach. To cure it, you muſt cool the Liver, and evacuate Choller. Firſt give a Laxative and cooling Cliſter; then, open the Liver-Vein in the right arm, and draw as much bloud as the patients ſtrength will well bear, either at once or at ſeverall times. Then make an Apozeme to purge Choller, thus, <hi>Take the roots of yellow Docks, or Muncks Ruharb, Sorrel, Succory, and Licoris, of each one Ounce, the Leaves of Endive, Succory, Fumitory, Dandelion, and Burrage, of each one handfull; of the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115825:128"/> great cold ſeeds, of each three Drachres: Of the Cordiall flowers, of each, one Pugill, Tamarinds one Ounce; boil them to a Pint and an half, then adde to infuſe of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb and Senna, of each half an Ounce, Syrrup of Succo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with Rubarb, and of Roſes Solutive, add at the last, and clarify it, aromatize it with two drachms of yellow Sanders.</hi> Let the Patient take it four mornings. Let his ordinary drink be Barly-water, and put therein the Syrrup of Lemmons or Maiden-hair; or, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in things that are ſharper, make it ſharp with the ſpirit of Sulphur, or Vitriol. Whey likewiſe is very good, it is beſt if it be made by turning the milk with Vinegar, or the juice of Lemmons, and add ſuch things as I adviſed for the Barly water. Likewiſe you may prepare Juleps to cool the Liver. <hi>Take the waters of Endive, Succory, Sorrel, and Bugloſſe, of each one ounce, the Syrrups of Lemmons, Sweet Apples, and Pomegranats, of each one ounce: of the Syrrup of Corall, compound half an ounce, the Oyl of Vitriol, ten drops, mix them, and make a Julep for four doſes;</hi> Or, <hi>Take of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of the flowers of Bugloſſe, Violets and Succory, of each one Ounce, the conſerve of Hips, one Ounce and an half, with Syrrup of Lemmons make an Opiate,</hi> and take a little often. Likewiſe you may make a decoction of China, and Hepatick hearbs, ſweetning it with the aforenamed Syrrups, and taking half a pint in the morning. Likewiſe of the aforenamed cooling hearbs you may make an Apozen to cool the Liver, or you may make a Bath to cool and moyſten the body.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe Inflammation of the Liver, is a hot Tumor, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by bloud, out of its proper veſſells, ſent into the ſubſtance of the Liver. This Tumor ariſeth either from pure bloud, or elſe the bloud is mixed with Choller, Flegme, or Melancholly, ſo producing either a true, Eryſipelous, Oedematous, or Schirrous Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. This Tumor is ſometimes in the gibbous, or hollow part, of the Liver. The cauſes of this diſeaſe are too much bloud, or the heat, thinneſſe or ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, and by its motion in the Veins it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thrown into the Liver: For, the Liver being hot and in pain, doth attract the humours to it ſelf: or by its weakneſſe, is forced to receive the burden that ſtronger parts lay upon it, according to the Proverb, The weakeſt goes to the walls. Sometimes an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Liver, by retaining the thick humours, which by a preternaturall heat is inflamed. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall cauſes are the ſame which cauſe heat of the Liver. To which add a ſtroak, or fall, bruiſing the Liver, or Medicines applyed to a cold ſtomach, or a Cupping-Glaſſe faſtned to the Region of the Liver. The ſigns of the diſeaſe, are heavineſſe in the right Hypocondrion, a weighty pain ſometimes extending it ſelf to the throat, and ſometimes to the lower ribs, a Feaver more or leſſe violent, according to the nature of the humour offending, <hi>viz.</hi> Choller, or Flegm, and difficulty of breathing, becauſe the motion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphragma is hindered, a dry chough, an unequal pulſe
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:115825:129"/> and like a Saw, the Tongue at the beginning red, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards black, great thirſt, loathing of meat, vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Choller, and ſometimes Flegm, a pale and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh colour of the whole body, red and flaming U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, the ſick hath more eaſe lying upon his back, then upon either ſide: for the moſt part he is coſtive, becauſe the heat of the Liver dryeth up the moyſture of the Chylus; but if the Liver be weak alſo, the ſick is looſe, and the excrements are like water wherein fleſh hath bin waſhed. If the Gibbous part of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be affected, you may feel the Tumor in the right Hypochondrion, the breath is fetched with difficulty, and the pain reacheth to the right ſide of the Throar. If the cavity of the Liver be affected, the Tumor is not felt, but becauſe that part lyeth upon the ſtomach there is greater loathing of meat, vomitting, thirſt, and ſometimes looſneſſe of the belly, by reaſon of the corruption, which the diſtemper of the Liver cauſeth in the Stomach. The ſigns of the cauſes are thus known, if the infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation be of bloud onely, the face is either red or duskiſh, the Pulſe is great and ſoft, the Urine is red and thick, the body is full of fleſh, and there is ſweetneſſe in the mouth; and for the moſt part, the Patient is young and hath fed high. If Choller cauſe the infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation, the face is yellow, the pulſe ſwift, hard and unequall, the Urine thin and yellow, the body thin, the eyes hollow, a bitter taſt in the mouth, and Cholerick vomitings. The Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of the inflamation of the Abdomen, differ little from them of the infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation of the Liver, therefore let us a little conſider the difference. If the Muſcles of the Abdomen be infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med, the skin is extended, and if you lay hold of it, you cannot move it, but if the Liver be inflamed, if you lay hold on the Muſcles, they yield, and the Tumor appeareth deeper. If theſe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115825:129"/> Muſcles be inflamed, the colour appeareth freſh, and in its naturall colour; but if the Liver be inflamed, the colour is yellow as in the Jaundiſe, you muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſtinguiſh between the infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation of the Liver, and a Pleuriſy. Sometimes moiſt and bloudy ſtools, diſtinguiſh it; in the Pleuriſy the pain will be vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and great towards the right Hypocondria, no change of colour, the cough great and dry, with bloudy ſpittle for the moſt part, the pulſe hard and like a Saw; the infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation of the Liver is manifoſted by the ſigns laid down before. If the Meſentery be inflamed, the Tumor appeareth beneath the region of the Liver, the ſtools will be thin and moiſt, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concocted matter; if the party recover, the matter quickly is concocted, the colour of the face is not much altered. <hi>Prog.</hi> every infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation of the Liver is dangerous, for the moſt part deadly: if the Patient be not cured, or killed preſently, the diſeaſe ends in a Dropſy, Atrophy, or Conſumption. If Choller be the cauſe of the infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation, it is worſe then if bloud were the cauſe, and the Feaver is ſtronger. The Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chough in this diſtemper, is a very evill ſign, for it ſhews the greater Malignity of the infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation, which doth diſturb the Stomach. A Flux joyned with it, unleſſe it be criticall, and the humours evacuated, concocted, is deadly. To cure it, follow the rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the 42. Chapt. Of the Infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation of the Stomach. Let his drink be Barly water, with a little Syrrup of Violets. If the diſeaſe be ſtubborn, to the former Medicines preſcribed in the 42. Chapter, add this following Apozeme. <hi>Take of the roots of Smallage, Fennell and Parſly, of each, two ounces; the leaves of Agrimony, Violets, Succory, and Maidenhair, of each one handfull; Polypody of the Oak four Ounces, Chammell flowers, one Ounce; the ſeeds of Fennell, Gromwell, and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:115825:130"/> Parſly, of each one Drachm: boil it to a Pint and an half, and in the ſtrained Liquor infuſe an Ounce of Sen na, and three Drachms of Rubarb; afterwards, add of Sirrup of violets and Vinegar Simple, of each, two Ounces:</hi> divide it into four Doſes, and let the Sick take every other Morning. Then make an Epithem, Liniment, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent, or Plaiſter, thus: <hi>Take of the Juyce of Endive, Succory, Sorrell, and Plantane, of each, half an Ounce: of the Oyls of Roſes, Wormwood, Camomill, and Myrtles, of each, one Ounce: Vinegar, half an Ounce: boil it to the Conſumption of the Juyces: then add of the three San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Powder, of each, one Scruple: with Wax ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, make an unguent,</hi> and anoint the Region of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. If the Pain and Feaver decreaſeth, you muſt add to the former Oyntment, ſuch things as diſſolve and mollify as well as cool: as the Flowers of Camomill and Melilot, Barly-meal, the Roots of Marſh-mallows, Calamus Aromaticus, and Cypreſſe: the Leaves of Mallows, Violets, and Agrimony: the Seeds of Anniſe, Fennell, Faenugreek, and Flax. Or with theſe Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples you may make a Fomentation.</p>
               <p>If the Inflammation be not diſcuſſed, as it ſeldom can, it tends to Suppuration; otherwiſe to a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene. The Impoſthume, for the moſt part, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in twenty dayes, it is very dangerous, and few eſcape thereof. But if it be little, and onely in one part of the Liver, and the Matter white which comes forth by Urine and Stool, the Sick eſcapeth; if it be in the outward part of the Liver, it may be opened by an actual Cautery, and if the Matter which cometh forth be white, the Patient eſcapeth. After the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume is broken, there remaineth an Ulcer, if the Patient continueth: the Ulcer is hard to cure, and bringeth the Patient into a Dropſy or Maraſmus. But ſometimes ſharp, cholerick, and corroding Humours
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:115825:130"/> in the Liver produce an Ulcer without Inflammation. This Ulcer is diſcovered by the Signes following: Pain in the right Hypocondrion, mattery and bloody Stools, and pain in the Bowels as in the Dyſentery; onely here the Weight and Pricking about the Liver maketh a Diſtinction: ſometimes pieces of the Liver have been voided by Stool. If the outward part of the Liver be ulcerated, the Urine is mattery, without any Diſeaſe in the Bladder or Reins. The Colour is yellow, ſometimes ſmall Pimples in the Face, a ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Breath, Loathing Fleſh, and the Sick fainteth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. An Ulcer in the Liver is accompanied (for the moſt part) with an Hective Feaver; for the moſt part Death lodgeth not farr from it: that which followeth an Impoſthume and Inflammation is more dangerous then the other. If it tends to Suppuration, it is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured, yet you muſt proceed, thus: <hi>Take of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaster of Diachilon magnum, and Melilot, of each, one Ounce: Gum Ammoniacum diſſolved in Vinegar, half an Ounce: Oyl of Wormwood and Wax, make a Plaiſter, and ſpread it upon Leather in the form of an half Moon,</hi> and apply it to the Region of the Liver. Make uſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of mollifying Cataplaſms. Give inwardly Chicken Broth, and boil therein Marſh and common Mallows, Figs, &amp;c. When the Impoſthume is broken, make uſe of the Medicines preſcribed for the Cure of an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in the Stomach; give him to drink Whey or Barly-Water and Hony of Roſes. If the Suppuration be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and after the opening thereof, the Matter is filthy, red and ſtinking, Death muſt perfect the Cure; but if the Matter evacuated be white and concocted, there is hopes of Recovery.</p>

                  </gap>, or the Obſtruction of the Liver, is a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe organical, a preternatural Straitneſſe of the Branches of the <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> and <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> as alſo the whole Subſtance of the Liver, which hinders the diſtribution of Blood and Nouriſhment, by reaſon of a preternatural Humour which ſhutteth up the Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The Quantity or Quality of the Humours may be the Cauſe of Obſtruction. Plenty of Humours cauſe Obſtruction in the Cavity of the Veſſels, which by ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are ſo diſtended, that they cannot contract them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſend forth the Matter. The Quality of the Humours is groſſe, tough, and clammy Excrements ſticking to the Paſſages, and are more thickned by the Heat of the part: <hi>viz.</hi> Phlegm which eaſily groweth thick and clammy; Mela choly, which is cold, thick, and droſſy: Choller, ſtaying long in the Liver, grows thick: and ſometimes the Thickneſſe of the Blood may cauſe Obſtruction; ſometimes groſſe Vapours may cauſe Obſtruction, as in the Chollick. All things which make thick and clammy Humours, as a cloudy and thick Air; Meats, that are aſtringent, cold, of groſſe Juyce, hard of Concoction being immoderately eaten, or more eaten, then the Conſtitution of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can well diſpenſe with; as Beef, Bacon, Pork, and Fiſh dryed in the Smoak; Cheeſe, Peaſe, Beans, &amp;c. Pears, Quinces, Medlars, Services, and Muſhrooms: Bread not well baked, muddy Ale, and aſtringent Wine. A cold Diſtemper of the Liver, which cannot
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115825:131"/> well concoct the Chylus, but turns it into a ſalt, tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarous, and mucilaginous Matter, may be the Cauſe of Obſtruction. Diſtempers of the Stomach, by reaſon of which it cannot well concoct, but beget crude Chyle, which the Liver cannot well order, may be the Cauſe. <hi>Diag:</hi> In this Diſtemper, the Excrements are not naturall, but are moiſt, white, chylous, or bloody: The Urine, white, thin, and warry: when the Patient walketh faſt, or up a Hill, he breatheth with difficulty: the Face pale, the whole Body lean and dull: a ſenſe of Weight in the Hypocondria, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially after Meat, and though the Sick hath eat Meat light, and little in Quantity, yet he ſeemeth as if he had overgorged himſelf. Sometimes the Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria is extended; and a dry Cough. The Cauſes are thus known: If the Pain be heavy, extended and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, groſſe Humours are the Cauſe. Sharper Pains, and more moveable, declare Wind. If cold Humours be the Cauſe; there is more Weight, the Face is pale, no Thirſt nor Feaver: a thick and cold Diet preceded: the contrary Signes declare hot Humours to be the cauſe, Choller maketh the Face yellow, and blood-red. <hi>Prog:</hi> An Obſtruction newly begun may be eaſily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: but an old, hardly. If the Obſtruction of the Liver be not removed, it breeds many dangerous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: in a word, it may be well called the Mother of all Diſeaſes. That which comes of crude &amp; phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Humours is worſe then that which comes of Wind. You muſt begin the Cure with univerſal Evacuations, ſuitable to the Nature of the Diſeaſe, the Strength and Conſtitution of the Patient. If Blood abound, open the Liver-Vein, but beware leſt you cool the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too much. Then you muſt make opening-Broths, thus: <hi>Take of the Roots of Smallage, Parſly, Fennell, and Aſparagus, of each, one Ource: Agrimony, Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hair,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115825:132"/> and Polypody of the Oak, of each, one handfull: the Seeds of Anniſe, Parſly, and Fennell, of each, one Drachm; boil them in Chicken or Mutton Broth, and ſtrain it;</hi> every Morning give the Sick a Porringer full, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving firſt therein, Cream of Tartar, one Drachm; Salt of Wormwood and Tamarisk, of each, half a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Or every other day infuſe in his Broth, half an Ounce of Senna, and give it as before. Baths and Fomentations made of ſottning and opening things are good: <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſh mallows, Lillyes, and Briony, of each, two Ounces; the middle Rind of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariſk, the Bark of Caper Roots, the Roots of Sea holly, Cypreſſe, and dwarf-Elder, of each, one Ounce: The Leaves of Marſh and common Mallows, Camomill, Mints, Germander, Penny-royall, Violets, and Wormwood, of each, one handfull: the Seed of Flax, Foenugreek, and Juniper Berryes, of each, one Ounce: the Flowers of Broom, Elder, Camomill, and Mililot, of each, one Handfull: boil them in chalybiated Water, and (if you pleaſe) add one part of white-Wine, and foment the Region of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> or with a greater Quantity make a Bath. Your Wit (if you have any) will teach you how to make Unguents, of the ſame ingredients, to anoint the part, after fomenting. It is good to have in readineſſe an Opiate that openeth Obſtructions, ſtrengthneth the Stomach, Liver, and other parts; <hi>Take of the Conſerve of Wormwood, two Ounces: the Root of Elicampane, and Citron Peels candied, of each, one Ounce: Candied Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, half an Ounce: one Myrabolan candied, Confectio Alchermes, two Drachms: Diarrhodon Abbatis, one Drachm: Salt of Wormwood and Tamariſk, of each one Scruple: Saffron, and Amber-greeſe, of each, half a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: with the Sirrup of the five opening Roots make an Opiate,</hi> of which let the Patient take the quantity of a Wal-nut every Merning.</p>

               <p>In this caſe ſteel-Medicines are of excellent uſe, and well approved of by <hi>Galeniſts</hi> as well as <hi>Paracelſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> ſometimes the Powder may be given alone, or of it may be made ſeveral ſorts of Medicines, as ſteel-Wine, Sirrups, Opiates, Pills, and Lozenges.

               </head>
               <p>THis Diſeaſe is a hard Tumor in the Liver without Pain: it is either perfect or imperfect; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is without Pain or Senſe: that which is imperfect hath ſome Pain. This is bred by crude, viſcous, and clammy Humours ſent from other parts, or bred in the Liver by evill Concoction. The imperfect Schir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus is cauſed by immoderate uſe of diſcuſſing, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percuſſive Medicines; or things which by cooling and binding do thicken the Matter, and keep it from diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. The Signs are, a Hardneſſe in the right Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condrion, and a great Heavineſſe, eſpecially, when the Breath is fetched, neither Feaver nor Pain, as in the Inflammation; or at leſt but little Pain, when the Schirrus is imperfect: the Face is pale and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, becauſe there is no good Blood produced by it. The whole Body decayeth, becauſe there is no Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, nor Diſtribution of Nouriſhment, as ought to be. To the Prognoſtick, <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith thus; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Schirrus is incurable: that which is ſenſible is curable, though with much difficulty. A Schirrus turns to the Dropſy incurable; ſometimes it cauſeth the Jaundice: and ſomtimes it cometh in the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, both which are very dangerous. To cure it in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, you muſt take away the antecedent Cauſe, as you are taught in the preceding chapter of Obſtructions, all the Medicines there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned are proper for this. <hi>Riverius</hi> much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth theſe Pills following: <hi>Take of the beſt Aloes, and

               <head>CHAP. LVII. <hi>Of the Jaundice.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Jaundice is a ſpreading of a yellow Colour o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole Body. There is a two fold Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, the yellow and the black; the black proceeds from the Spleen, and is rare. I ſhall here ſpeak one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the yellow Jaundice. This Diſeaſe comes from three principal Cauſes: Firſt, from an evil Diſpoſition of the Liver, as an Inflammation, Obſtruction, Schir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, or Weakneſſe thereof, that it cannot ſeparate the Choller from the Blood, and by that means it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried over the whole Body. A ſecond Cauſe is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Gall, which hinders its paſſage into the Guts, and ſo remains in the Blood, with which it is carried to all parts of the Body. The Gall is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, either by groſſe Phlegm, or Choller aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſometimes by little ſtones bred therein, &amp;c. The third Cauſe is the Malignity of the cholerick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which conſiſteth, either in the great Quantity which Nature cannot regulate, nor ſeperate from the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:115825:134"/> Blood: or fills the Bagg ſo full that it cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it ſelf to expell it. Or elſe it conſiſteth in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Quality of the Humour, which, by corrupting the reſt, hinders their due Evacuations, which Nature perceiving, ſtriveth ſuddenly to caſt it forth: as it ſometimes happens in cholerick Feavers, after the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Poyſon, or after the biting of ſome venemous Creature. The Signes of the yellow Jaundice is a Yellowneſſe of the Body, eſpecially, the whites of the Eyes and the Balls of the Checks: cholerick Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and Hiccoughs, Lazineſſe, Itching of the Body, and Bitterneſſe of the Tongue. If it come from a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper of the Liver: there preceded an Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Obſtruction, &amp;c. If from an Obſtruction of the Gall, the Belly is bound and the Excrements white, the Urine yellow or reddiſh, which will dye a new piece of linnen cloth. If it come from the Malignity of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, both the Urine and the Excrements are high co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, eſpecially, after a putrid Feaver, now if the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver remain, the Jaundice is Symptomatical; If, when the Jaundice appears, the Feaver ceaſeth, the Urine and Excrements be of their natural Colour; the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice is critical. Poyſon taken and venemous Bitings the Patient can declare. They, who in a Feaver have the Jaundice before the ſeventh or critical day, are in great danger; the contrary, if it happen on a critical day. The Jaundice, comming upon an Inflammation of the Liver, is dangerous, becauſe the Diſeaſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ends in an Impoſthume: if upon a Schirrus, it is no leſſe dangerous, becauſe that ends in the Dropſy. If it come from an Obſtruction of the Gall, it is moſt eaſy to cure, becauſe the Paſſage is neer the Guts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Stones bred in the Paſſages be the Cauſe, which, by reaſon they cannot be diſſolved, are counted incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. For the Cure, if it come from Diſtemper of the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:115825:134"/> Liver, have recourſe to the aforegoing Chapters, if the Jaundice be critical it needs no Cure. If from the Obſtruction of the Gall; to cure it, take away the the Obſtruction, which may be done, by the Medicines mentioned in the Chapter <hi>Of the Obstruction of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> Yet leaſt I ſhould ſeem to omit any thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, I ſhall apply a Medicine or two proper to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. If the Body be plethorick, Phlebotomy may be profitable. Afterwards evacuate the Humours with Medicines that principally purge Choller: <hi>Take of the Electuary of the Juyce of Roſes, and the Electuary of Prunes ſolutive, of each three Drachms: Rubarb in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, one Drachm: Saffron, half a Scruple: with Sugar make a Bolus,</hi> give it once or twice, as the Patient ſtands in need thereof. Then make a Decoction thus: <hi>Take the Roots of Smallage, Nettles, and Maddir, of each, one Handfull: the Leavs of Celandine, Cleavers, Fumitory, Wormwood, Century, and the Tops of Saint John's Wort, of each, one Handfull: Cinnamon, and the Shavings of Ivory, of each, two Drachms: the white Dung of an Hen, and the Dung of a Gooſe, of each, two Drachms, tye it up in a Ragg, and with it a Scruple of Saffron: make a Decoction in white Wine, (or if you pleaſe, in Fumitory, Wormwood-water, or the like) to a Quart:</hi> Let the Patient take a quarter of a Pint fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and gently exerciſe himſelf. Of theſe, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of the like Nature may any form of Medicine be prepared. Whilſt inward Medicines are adminiſtred, foment or anoint the Region of the Liver, as you are taught in the foregoing Chapters.</p>

                  <hi>Leucophlegmatia. Aſcites</hi> is a Swelling of the Belly, cauſed of a ſerous Humour, and ſalt, (as Water it is cold, as Salt it is hot, infecting the Mouth of the Stomach, hence cometh a Feaver and Thirſt,) and not onely the Belly, but ſometimes the Cods, Thighs, Legs, and Feet: and ſometimes it begins in the Legs and Feet and aſcends upward. It is the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of moſt Phyſitians, that all Dropſyes have their originall from a cold Diſtemper of the Liver, which cannot make Blood, but Water, Phlegm, and Wind. This Opinion is undeniably true in <hi>Anaſarca,</hi> but in <hi>Aſcites</hi> and <hi>Tympanites</hi> it is queſtionable, although ſometimes a cold Diſtemper may be the Cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The Experience of Modern Phyſitians hath put the buſineſſe out of doubt, who have found the Liver ſound in diſſected Bodyes, who died of the Dropſy. And if the Liver ſhould breed warry Blood; what reaſon can be given that the Water ſhould be ſent to the Cavity of the Belly onely, and not to other parts, and breed <hi>Anaſarca?</hi> A Dropſy may be cauſed by a hot Diſtemper of the Liver cauſed of Feavers, much Wine, or hot Meats, which doth diſperſe the native Heat, by which means, the Liver, Spleen, and Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys become leſſe active, and not able to draw the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor caſt it forth by the Ureters: the like may be
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115825:135"/> ſaid of a cold Diſtemper. Some external Cauſe may hinder the Attraction and Diſtribution of the Water, as, namely, the drinking of much cold Water, or hot Wine, or any thing that doth diminiſh or diſperſe the native Heat.</p>
               <p>The Dropſy <hi>Tympanites,</hi> hath its Name from <hi>Tympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> a Drum, becauſe the Belly ſoundeth like a Drum; and is much ſtretched out. This Stretching hath its original from Wind ſhut up in the Cavity of the <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and ſometimes in the Cavity of the Guts as <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi> obſerved. This Wind is bred by crude and thick, phlegmatick or melancholy Humours, which being ſtirred by Heat, and made thin, becometh thick and flatuous Vapours, which are hard to be diſſolved. Nor doth Wind alone cauſe a Dropſy but with it a mixture of Water, ſo that if Wind be predominant, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Tympany:</hi> if Water, <hi>Aſcites. Anaſarca</hi> is bred of a phlegmatick Humour ſpread throughout the whole Body, and maketh every part to ſwell and be white: a cold Diſtemper of the Liver is the Cauſe; when the Liver, inſteed of making good Blood, produceth ſuch Humours. The Cauſe of this Diſeaſe may be imputed to all ſuch things as cool the Liver too much, and hinder its Concoction, as a Diet too cold and moiſt, the Stopping of the Terms or Haemorrhoids, all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and Tumors in the Liver, much bleeding, or any praeternatural Evacuation.</p>
               <p>You may make the Diagnoſticks thus; In <hi>Aſcites,</hi> the Belly is great and broad, preſſe the Sides and you may hear the Water make a Noiſe: when the Patient turneth in his Bed, his Belly ſwayeth to that ſide: the Thighs, Legs, Feet, and Cods ſwell, but the upper parts decay: the Urine is little in Quantity, thick in Subſtance, in colour, red: In the encreaſe of the Diſeaſe, the Patient breatheth with much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:115825:136"/> by reaſon of the Abundance of Water which lyeth upon the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> eſpecially, when he lyeth down; therefore the Patient (for the moſt part) is forced to ſtand or ſit: the ſalt Humour ſwimming in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach cauſeth a continuall Thirſt, and a lingring Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. In the <hi>Tympany</hi> the Belly ſoundeth like a Drum, is big but leſſe burthenſome; when the Patient lyeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Back, his Belly remaineth hard and extended, nor doth it ſway when he turneth himſelf: the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Dropſy (for the moſt part) is accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pain about the Navel and Reins. In <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarca,</hi> not onely the Belly &amp; lower parts, but the upper parts alſo ſwell; if you thruſt the Swelling with your Finger, it doth pit and leave an Impreſſion: the Fleſh is ſoft and looſe, and the Skin pale and earthy: they have a lingring Feaver, breathing difficultly, and the Urine is thin and white.</p>
               <p>To the Prognoſtick, I ſay; Every Dropſy is hard to be cured, the older the Parient is, and the longer the Diſeaſe hath continued, the more perillous. <hi>Anaſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> is leaſt dangerous: <hi>Aſcites</hi> and the <hi>Tympany</hi> are ſometimes one more dangerous then another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Cauſes: for <hi>Aſcites</hi> comming from a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor or Ulcer of the Liver or any of the internall parts, it is more dangerous then a <hi>Tympany, et è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra.</hi> If a Dropſy come upon an acute Diſeaſe, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. If the Liver, being full of Water, diſcharge it ſelf into the <hi>Omentum,</hi> the Diſeaſe ends in Death. If in the beginning a Dropſy, (the Patient being ſtrong, and free from Tumor or Ulcer in the Liver or any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part,) the Water floweth into the Belly and cauſeth a Flux, the Patient is cured; if the contrary happen, expect a contrary effect. This I gather from the words of <hi>Hippocrates; In the beginning of a Dropſy, if there come a Flux of the Belly, without want of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115825:136"/> or crudity it is prevented,</hi> the leſſe Urine is void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the worſe, becauſe the drink runs not to the Reins, but to the Belly. It is a very hopefull ſigne, when the Patient voideth more Urine then he drinketh, and the belly grow leſſe. Impoſtumes or ſpots in the Legs of Hydropicall men, are for the moſt part forerunners of death. If a man who hath been cured of the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie fall into the ſame againe, it is very dangerous; If a melancholly body have a Tympany, he ſeldome eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes; eſpecially if he piſſe by drops. If the Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall perſon eate his meat and digeſt it well, and be not ſick after, have no cough nor pain, his tongue not rough nor thirſty: if he be in a naturall order without phyſick, and medicines work eaſily with him; if he be not faint, and his Urine change according to his Diet, he may eaſily be cured.</p>
               <p>For the cure, you muſt conſider if the diſeaſe hath its originall from obſtructions, Tumors, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> And ſeek the beginning of your cure out of their proper Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Afterwards you muſt labour to evacuate the matter, whether it be in the Abdomen or whole body, firſt make an Apozem thus: <hi>Take of the roots of Parſly, Smallage, Fennell, Elicampane, Bruſcus, Danewort, and Madder, of each one ounce: The Leaves of Agrimony, Wormwood, Maidenhaire, the tops of St. Johns wort, and Century, of each one handfull: the inward bark of the roots of Capers, Aſh and Tamarisk, of each four drachms: Liquoriſh, one ounce: the ſeeds of Fennell, Parſly and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper berryes, of each half an ounce: the flowers of Broom, Beans and Elder, of each, one pugill: Julep roots, two drachms: boile them in a ſufficient quantity of water, wherein ſteel hath been quenched, to a pint and an half: ſtrain it, and add to the Liquor, one ounce of Senna, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it and let it infuſe ſix houres, ſtrain it and diſſolve therein of the ſyrup of Harts-tongue one ounce: and the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:115825:137"/> of Succory, with Rubarb three ounces: Clarifie it with the whites of Eggs, and aromatize it with two drachms of Cinnamon, or yellow Sanders; give it four mornings.</hi> Afterwards once a week give this pouder; <hi>Take of Senna, Jallap, Mechoacah, Turbith, Gum, and Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacts, of each one drachm: Cream of Tartar, and Salt of Wormwood, of each two drachms: Cambugia half a drachm: Diamher, Diarrhodon abbatis, and Fennell ſeeds, of each two ſcruples:</hi> make a fine ponder, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe one drachm in a quarter of a point of White-wine all night, and let the Patient take it in the morning. Of theſe and ſuch like may be prepared medicines of all formes. Some commend the juyce of flowerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luce roots, taken with hony or manna, the doſe is three ounces, and <hi>Platerus</hi> in his Obſervations doth highly extoll it. <hi>Chimiſts</hi> do much commend the extract of black Hellebore, <hi>Mercurius vitae and Diaphoreticus, Mercurius dulcis, antimonium Diaphoreticum,</hi> and ſuch like: but let the phyſitian beware how he gives medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines of this nature, except his Patient be ſtrong; the like caution let him obſerve in giving of purging me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, eſpecially ſuch as purge with violence. But rather let him (if his Patient be weake) give diſcuſſive and Diuretick Cliſters, thus. <hi>Take of Mallows, Marſh-Mallows, Chamomell, pellitory of the wall, and Mercury, of each one handfull: the ſeeds of Annis, Sweet Fennell, Caraway, Dill, and Bay-berryes, of each two drachms: the flowers of Broom and Melilot, of each one pugil: boyle them in Poſſet drink or Mutton broath to a pint, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve in the ſtrained liquor, of Oyle, of Camomell, Dill and Rue, of each one ounce: Diacatholicon (or Diaphaenicon) of each one ounce: (and if you ſee good, add half an ounce of Benedicta Laxativa) and make a Clister:</hi> you muſt principally give ſuch medicines which purge by Urine: the ſteeled-wine preſcribed in the 55. chap. is very good;
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:115825:137"/> in the preparing of it, you may add (if you ſee occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) any of the aforementioned ingredients, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Urine. The Spirit of Vitrioll, Tartar and Salt is much commended, if it be adminiſtred in ſome Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick decoction. The ſalt of Wormword and Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per profiteth much. Or you may make a Lee of the Aſhes of Juniper and White-Wine, giving five or ſix ounces thereof, which Lee alone hath cured ſome Dropſies ſaith <hi>Mathiolus;</hi> the ſame I have known my ſelf. Bleeding is prohibited, and upon good grounds too, unleſſe the diſeaſe come from ſtoppage of the Termes or Hemorrhoids, bleed not then, unleſſe it be in the beginning of the diſeaſe, and the Liver in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall condition. Iſſues, Bliſters, and Scarifications are likewiſe forbidden, becauſe they gangren for the moſt part: yet in the beginning of a Dropſie, the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer parts being exceedingly ſwelled, I made an Iſſue in the Leg, out of which an incredible quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter iſſued, and the Patient perfectly cured. Among Evacuations, Sweatings are not the leaſt profitable, eſpecially in Anaſarca; but in Aſcites and Tympanites the Liver being dry, beſides the difficulty of procuring it, it rather hurteth then profiteth. All the time of the cure forget not to ſtrengthen the Liver, that you may hinder the encreaſe of water, as well as purge it; have recourſe to the 55, Chapter of the Obſtruction of the Liver. <hi>Hollerius</hi> commendeth this opiate: <hi>Take of Currance cleanſed, half a pound: boyle them in Sack till they be as thick as a pultis, heat and ſtrain them, then add of the Conſerve of Roſemary flowers, Citron peels Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, and Cinnamon, of each one drachm: the pouder A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romaticum Roſatum Diamargariton, Calidum, and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinamon, of each two ſcruples: Lignum Aloes, half a drachm: Saffron half a ſcruple, mix them and make a ſoft Electuary.</hi> Then make a fomentation for the belly
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:115825:138"/> with theſe, or hearbs of the like nature: Agrimony Danewort, Chamomell, Calamint, Elder, Mallows, &amp; Marſh-Mallowes, Marjerom, Melilot, Broom, Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royall, Rue, Snakweed, Southern wood, Tamarisk, Wormwood, and the like, the ſeeds of Parſly, Dill, Cummin, Fennell, Bay, and Juniper berryes: foment the belly with ſpunges dipt in the decoction of theſe, or lay the hearbs themſelves in a bag hot to the belly: Afterwards, anoynt the belly with the oyle of Dill, Chamomell, Rue, Flowerdeluce, and the like. Or you may make Unguents, Cataplaſms, or Emplaſters. This harmleſſe Cataplaſm I have found profit much: <hi>Take of Wormwood, Chamomell, Mayweed and Danewort of each two handfulls, bruiſe them in a ſtone morter, then boyle them in Vinegar and Hony, then with Bean and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meale, and Cow-dung dryed, of each a like quantity make a Cataplaſm. Galen</hi> commendeth a Cataplaſm of Snailes, bruiſed with their ſhells, and layd upon the Navell, and there keep it till it falls off of its own accord. Radiſhes bruiſed and laid to the Belly and Reynes, worketh by ſtoole and Urine. To conclude, If the body be ſtrong, you may uſe ſtrong purgers in your Cataplaſms, but if the body be weak forbeare. In Anaſarca you may often and ſtrongly purge watry, and flegmatick humors: In Aſcites and Tympanites more ſeldome and gentle. In Aſcites, order your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and externall medicines principally to purge water: in Tympanites let them be Carminative and diſcuſſive. In every of them have a ſpeciall reſpect to the Liver; and if it be too hot (as it ſomtimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth) give cold things mixed with warm openers; Let their meat be of the dryeſt, and let them ſhun ſweet-meats as a Plague. For drink let them abſtaine from it as much as can be, and drink none but what is made with Wormwood, Tamarisk, Elecampane, Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:115825:138"/> 
                  <hi>&amp;c:</hi> or let them only hold it in the mouth to coole and aſſwage their thirſt, let them chew Maſtick, for it draweth water from the Stomack.</p>

If the humors grow thick and hard, it breeds a Scirrhus. If the Tumor be phlegmatick, it is called Oedma, which chanceth to them, who live upon cold and moyſt food, or live in a moyſt ayre. But if it be ſoft; looſe &amp; puffed up, it is called an inflammation or puffing of the Spleen, The cauſes of the Obſtruction, Inflammation, &amp; tumour of the Spleen, are the ſame with them of the Liver: Sometimes the affect ſeizeth on both together.</p>
               <p>They are diſtinguiſhed by their Signes: the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Spleen is diſtinguiſhed from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Liver, by the ſcituation of the part. If the Spleen be obſtructed, there is heavineſſe and pain in the left Hypochondrion, eſpecially after running, riding, or any more than ordinary exerciſe; if you handle the hypochondrion there is reſiſtance, the face is blewiſh, and Signes of melancholly appeare, the diſeaſe is of long continuance, and if it be not ſpeedily cured, it turnes to a Scirrhus. The cure is performed the ſame way, as the Obſtruction of the Liver is; only you muſt add things, which particularly reſpect the Spleen, and purge the Melancholly humor.</p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:115825:139"/>
               <p>The inflammation of the Spleen likewiſe hath the ſame conjunct and antecedent cauſe, only it is eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cauſed by Melancholly Blood. The Diagnoſtick Signes are different, <hi>viz:</hi> the Patient hath ſwelling, pain, heavineſſe, and beating on the left ſide under the ribs, thirſt, blackneſſe of the tongue, loathing of meat, a conſtant fever, troubleſome lying on either ſide, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the right, ſomtimes the Tumor is in the ſhape of the Spleen: Somtimes fills the left Hypochondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and if the adjacent parts be inflamed alſo, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth below the Navell. If only Melancholly blood cauſe the inflammation, the Tumor is harder, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour black, and many times the Urine: If choler be mixed with melancholly blood, the thirſt is greater, the Fever ſtronger, and worſe every third day; the mouth bitter, and the Urine red: great want of ſleep and doting. If phlegme be mixed, the former ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes are leſſened.</p>
               <p>The Prognoſtick is the ſame with the inflammation of the Liver, only it is leſſe dangerous, for as much as the Liver is the nobler part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If it endeth not in Death, it endeth by ſome criticall Evacuation, as by Stoole, Urine or Bleeding at the left Noſtrill, or elſe it grows hard, and turnes to a Schirrhus. Which may be known by the cauſes and ſignes laid down in the Chapter of the Schirrhus, of the Liver; only it appeareth on the contrary ſide. The cure of this and the former may be performed by the medicines, laid down in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the inflammation, obſtruction, and Schirrhus of the Liver, only make uſe of ſome things that eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpect the Spleen, and purge melancholly, as I hinted before.</p>
               <p>Somtimes the Spleen is much pained by wind, which ſtretcheth the Spleen and its membranes, but is without fever or hardneſſe. It is eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115825:139"/> former griefs, but hardly from the Chollick, by reaſon of the neerneſſe of the Gut <hi>Colon:</hi> but you may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh them thus: the pain of the Spleen is weighty and in one place: but of the Chollick is ſtretching, ſharp, moveable, and runs over the whole Belly. The Cure muſt be wrought by Medicines carminative, emollient, and diſcuſſive, given internally, or Cliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ſame Nature, with Fomentations and Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, made of the Oyls of Wormwood, Lillyes, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momell, Capers, and ſuch like, adding a little of the Oyl of Spike: and, if the pain ceaſe not, ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Application of a Cupping-Glaſſe; but be well adviſed firſt, whether there be no Defluxion or Inflammation.</p>

               <p>THis Diſeaſe hath its Originall from melancholly and aduſt Humours, which are bred by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper of the Spleen, or Stomach, which, by reaſon of of their Crudity, ſtay long in the Veins, Arteries, and other Paſſages, which cauſe great and grievous Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations or Workings, from whence noiſome Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours aſcend to the Brain, Heart, and Midriff, which cauſe divers Symptoms, which I ſhall mention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. The antecedent Cauſes are, all Meats of evill Juyce, and of hard Digeſtion; long continued Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Sadneſſe, becauſe they diſperſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and hinder Concoction, and cauſe Credityes, which being burnt by Heat, turn to Melancholy. Much Study, Watching, and want of Excerciſe may
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115825:140"/> be the Cauſe by reaſon of much Retention of Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; hence it is, that learned men, and ſuch who ſit much, are troubled with this Diſeaſe. The Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of the Terms or Haemorrhoids may be the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The Diagnoſtick Signs of this Diſeaſe are many, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the parts affected: Sometimes the Patient ſpitteth or vomiteth much, becauſe the Stomach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocteth ill, and turneth the Nouriſhment into watry, ſharp, ſowr, or clammy Subſtance, which not being drawn away by the Guts, ly in the Stomach, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſcharge themſelves as aforeſaid. Sometimes the boiling of theſe Humours in the Stomach cauſeth flaruous Vapours, which ſtretch the Stomach and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the Heart, and cauſe Swooning: Theſe Vapours cauſe a Noiſe beneath the Ribs, hence it hath been called the windy Diſeaſe. Sometimes the Wind reacheth to the Kidneys, and cauſeth great Pain there, which maketh the Patient think he hath the Stone. He is often coſtive, becauſe the clammy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours (bred by evill Concoction) ſtick to the Guts: ſometimes the Sharpneſſe of the Humours cauſeth the Belly to be ſoluble. There is great Heat in the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condria, ſo that the Face will grow red and hot from thoſe Vapours. Sometimes the Urine is thin, becauſe thick and tartarous Humours ſtop the Paſſages: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thick, red, and troubled, and hath a thick tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarous Sediment, and ſometimes ſtick to the bottom of the Urin all like Sand, which cauſeth a Suſpition of the Stone, but this diſſolves between the Fingers like Salt, and that which is bred in the Reins is hard. The Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours aſcending produce many Symptomes, as, Palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Heart, a diſtempered Pulſe; if they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the Tongue and Pallat, it cauſeth great Thirſt: if to the Lungs, difficulty of the Breathing: if to the Membranes of the Brain, Head ach: if to the Brain it
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115825:140"/> ſelf, Dimneſſe of ſight, Noiſe in the Ears, Giddineſſe, Fear, and melancholy Phantaſies; if they be very ſharp, they ſometimes cauſe the Falling-Sickneſſe, and if they ſettle in the Nervs, Convulſion: if they be ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifying, they cauſe Numbneſſe, the Palſy, Apoplexy, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> If the Vapours be hot and dry, they dry the Brain, and cauſe Watchings, troubleſom Sleep, and frightfull Dreams. Note that all theſe Symptoms are not to be expected in one and the ſame Patient, but more or fewer according to the variety of the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Humours.</p>
               <p>Prognoſticks are: A continual Pain and Giddineſſe of the Head in a Hypocondry, doth threaten an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſy, Apoplexy, or Blindneſſe, and the like. Thick Urine is better then thin, for thin Urine is a Sign that thick Humours are detained in the Body. Vomiting, Flux of the Belly, or Haemorrhoids, if it be moderate, and continue not long, is a hopefull Sign, judge the contrary if it continue long. For the moſt part, this Diſeaſe is of long continuance, and ſeldom cured, therefore it hath been called the Scourge and Diſgrace of Phyſitians.</p>
               <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe conſiſteth in four things, Firſt, in opening Obſtructions: Secondly, in amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Diſtempers of the Bowells: Thirdly, in eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating the peccant Humours: and, Laſtly, in ſtrengthning the affected and vitall parts. But, to forbear Tediouſneſſe, and to avoid needleſſe Reperiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I refer you to the Chapters aforegoing, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Of the Obſtruction of the Liver and Spleen.</hi> Take this general Rule, keep the Body alwayes ſoluble, by Medicines which the Parient may uſe before Meat, changing them often; as often as need ſhall require let the Patient be purged, let him make uſe of Broths, Decoctions, and Drinks that have a Faculty to open
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115825:141"/> Obſtructions; as the Juyce of Wormwood, or Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood-Wine, adding thereto Tamarisk, Agrimony, Borrage, and Bugloſſe, Burnet, Sanders, Roſemary Flowers, and the like. <hi>Montanus</hi> much commendeth <hi>Venice Turpentine;</hi> becauſe it looſeneth the Belly, cleanſeth and warmeth the Stomach: provoketh U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine: openeth the Obſtructions of the Liver, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and doth not heat it. Steel-Wine, and other Medicines made of Steel, which you may find in the Chapter <hi>Of the Obſtruction of the Liver,</hi> powerfully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth Obſtructions, eſpecially the Extract of Steel, in the Adminiſtration of which, I have found more then ordinary Succeſſe: but let Medicines of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be adminiſtred by a skilfull and carefull Phyſitian. The Decoction or Infuſion of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum</hi> doth open Obſtructions ſafely and pleaſantly. And ſome do much commend the Decoction of the Root of ſweet Bryar for the Patient's ordinary drink. Whilſt you uſe internall Medicines, Externalls are not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, <hi>viz.</hi> Fomentations, Oyntments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuch as are preſcribed for the Obſtruction of the Liver and Spleen; chooſe the cooleſt of them and apply them to the Hypocondria. And, becauſe in this Diſeaſe the Stomach alwayes ſuffereth, ſeek the Remedy in its proper place. Or if the Vapours aſcending from the Hypochondria, trouble the Heart or Brain, and cauſe Swooning, Palpitation, Trembling, Convulſions, Head-ach, or the like, have recourſe to the Chapters preceding, which treat of thoſe Diſeaſes.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe Scurvy is nothing elſe but an Hypocondriack Diſeaſe, but having a peculiar degree of Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ariſing from the Putrefaction of Melancholy, it hath more Symptomes then in the Hypocondriack Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diag:</hi> All the Symptoms mentioned in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, are common to the Scurvy. Peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Symptoms are theſe, Redneſſe, Itching, Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Bleeding and Stinking of the Gums, Mouth, and Teeth, which are alſo (ſometimes) black and looſe. Spots in the Legs, firſt red, afterwards purple, black or blew. Straitneſſe of the Breaſt and Shortneſſe of Breath, occaſioned by thick Vapours, ariſing from the Hypocondria to the Midriff, or to the Sweet-Bread, cauſing a Swelling or Tumor, and conſequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Diaphragma. The Body is heavy and lazy, eſpecially the Legs, and grievous pain there and in other parts, as in the Toes, Fingers, Soals of the Feet, Ancles, Thighs, Belly, Arms, Shoulders, and the like. The Urine is various, as in the Hypocondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack Melancholy. The Pulſe is weak and unequall. Some have the head-Ach, and a ſeavouriſh Heat in the Night, which vaniſheth by a Morning Sweat. Some have tho Tooth-Ach without manifeſt Cauſe. Sometimes the Vapours aſcending (being aſtringent) contract the Gullet, and the Patient feareth ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. A ſtinking Breath is common to <hi>Scorbutick</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Tumors in divers parts, ſometimes hard, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſoft like Bladders, and ſometimes like the ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:115825:142"/> of Nettles. And laſtly, an <hi>Atrophy,</hi> Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and generall decay of the whole Body.</p>
               <p>That I may more perfectly diſcover the Symptoms of this Diſeaſe, I ſhall here lay down ſome other, which are common to other Diſeaſes, and ſhew you how to diſtinguiſh them. Sometimes the Scurvy cauſeth pains in the Joynts, which muſt be diſtinguiſhed from the pains cauſed by the French Pox thus: In the French Pox, the pains are between the Joynts, and by long continuance cauſe Knots there: the Symptoms of the Pox appear, as Running of the Reins, Bubo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or the Patient hath acted with ſome unclean wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But in the Scurvy, ſome of the preceding Symptoms appear, or at leaſt the Patient is of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Conſtitution. This muſt be diſtinguiſhed alſo from the <hi>Arthritis</hi> or Joynt-Gout, which is fixed, or at leaſt ſeldome changeth the place; but in the Scurvy it is very moveable, running from one Joynt to another, and ſometimes for a while vaniſheth. In the ſame manner is the baſtard-Palſy (which the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy cauſeth) diſtinguiſhed from a true one, which is conſtant; but in the <hi>Scorbaticall</hi> Palſy, he that one day could not walke or ſtand at all, can the next day walk with little or no help. Sometimes it cauſeth a Flux of the Belly like a <hi>Diarrhoea,</hi> but differeth from it in this, that the Excrements are thicker then in the former, and in greater Quantity, exceeding the Quantity of the Meat taken. Sometimes the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are mixed with Blood, but differeth from the <hi>Dyſentery,</hi> becauſe there is no pain of the Belly, and the Blood is thick, ſent thither by the Meſeraick Veins. Sometimes the <hi>Scorbatick</hi> pains are in the ſides imitating the Pleuriſy, but is much different; becauſe the Feaver (if any) is weaker; there is no difficulty of Breathing, no Cough, Spitting, nor conſtant pain.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:115825:142"/> Laſtly, you muſt diſtinguiſh theſe pains from the pains of the Stone: for the Urine is ſometimes red, like Blood, as if the Kidneys were wounded by the Stone, and ſometimes black, both which come from a ſcurvy ſalt Matter in the Spleen, or Parts adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prog:</hi> This Diſeaſe is very hard to be cured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Melancholy Humour is ſo farr predominant. Many times it is very dangerous, becauſe it bringeth the Dropſy, Conſumption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Diſeaſes, as the Apoplexy, Swoonings, and the like, which produce ſudden deaths.</p>
               <p>In the Cure of the Scurvy, you muſt follow the Method preſcribed in the Cure of Obſtruction of the Liver and Spleen, beginning with the weakeſt firſt; with which, you muſt make uſe of ſpecificall Medicines for the Scurvy; of which, the chief are, Dutch and Sea Scurvy-graſſe, Water Creſſes, Brook-Lime, Horſe-Radiſhes, Fumitory, Wormwood, Celandine the leſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe which are of leſſe Efficacy, and have a Faculty to correct and prepare the melancholy Humour, are theſe which follow, Agrimony, Aſarum, Bettony, Borrage, Bugloſſe, Carduus, Ceterach, Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campane, Germander, Hyſſop, Maidenhair of all ſorts, Polypody of the Oak; the Bark of Aſh, Capers, and Tamarisk; the Flowers of Elder, Dodder of Time, and Tamarisk. Obſerve this general Rule, if the Patient be feavouriſh or ſubject to heats, you muſt give the hotteſt of them in a ſmaller Quantity; and add Endive, Sorrel, Succory; the Juyce of Citrons, Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and Orenges: and the Spirit of Sulphur and Vitriol. Of theſe and ſuch like, may ſeveral ſorts of Medicines be formed, which (for Brevity ſake) I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LXII. <hi>Of the Stone in the Kidneys.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe material Cauſe of the Stone in the Kidneys, is a phlegmatick, feculent, thick, ſlimy, and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarous Humour in the Urine: the efficient Cauſe is Heat, which drieth and hardneth the Matter, and at length turneth it into a Stone; this is the Opinion of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and moſt modern Phyſitians. The Hermetick Phyſitians have found a certain Juyce, which they call <hi>Succus Lapidiſcens,</hi> which is a certain Humour, naturally proper to turn to a Stone, and this they ſay is the material Cauſe of the Stone: and the efficient Cauſe to be <hi>Spiritus Lapidiſcens,</hi> a ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making Spirit. So that if a man eat or drink any thing wherein the Stony Juyce is, that Juyce is turned into a Stone, if the Reins have a Stone-making Spirit. But if the Reins be free from this Spirit, a Stone is not bred, unleſſe the ſtony-Juyce be very predominate: on the contrary, if the Reins have this ſtony Faculty, and the Food be free from this Juyce, the Stone is ſcarcely engendered, unleſſe the ſtone-making Faculty be very predominate. Many Hiſtoryes ſhew that Stones come from a ſtone-making ſpirit, or Breath out of the Earth, which hath turned the Bodyes of Men, Beaſts, and other things into Stone: <hi>Riverius</hi> upon this Subject (in his laſt Edition) quoteth <hi>Aventius Annal. Bavar. lib.</hi> 7 <hi>An.</hi> 1343, who ſaith, that above fifty men, with many Cows, were turned into Stone. <hi>Ortellius</hi> tells the ſame ſtory of whole heards in <hi>Ruſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a.</hi> And <hi>Camerarius</hi> reporteth, that in the Province
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:115825:143"/> of <hi>Chilo</hi> in <hi>Armenia,</hi> at the blaſt of a South Wind (which happeneth four times in a year) whole Troops of horſe have been turned into Statues of ſtone, ſtanding in the warlick poſture in which they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The Antecedent Cauſes are many, The Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach being not able to concoct well, ſendeth a crude Chyle to the Liver; A hot Liver doth bake the chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Matter; or a cold Liver maketh crude Blood: the Spleen weak or obſtructed, doth not ſufficiently purge the droſſy Blood; theſe do cauſe even the Blood, or crude Juyces fit to make a Stone. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Reins, beſides their conjunct Cauſe, may be an Antecedent Cauſe in two reſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Form: Firſt, their Temper being hot doth violently draw the crude Matter and thicken it. In reſpect of their Form, the emulgent Veins may be looſe, and fit to receive the tartarous Matter into the Reins; and the Ureters ſo narrow that the thick Matter hath not paſſage from the Kidneys. Laſtly, all Food that produceth crude, thick, and ſlimy Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, doth afford Matter for the Stone, as Fleſh or Fiſh that is very ſalt or dryed in the ſmoak, Pulſe, Cheeſe, and all Milk-Meats, hard Eggs, Cheſnuts, Pears, Quinces, Medlars, Rice, Wine thick and not well purged, ſtanding Waters; all things which make the Liver and Reins too hot; as old ſtrong Wine, Garlick, Onions, Pepper, and Ginger; too ſtrong Diureticks, which carry crude Matter too violently to the Reins: violent Excerciſe after Meat, inordinate Lechery; too much Fulneſſe or Emptineſſe, and the like.</p>
               <p>The Signs of the Stone of the Kidneys are many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> a conſtant pain about the Loyns; whilſt it is in the hollow of the Kidneys, the pain is heavy, when it gets into the head of the Ureters, ſharp and pricking,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:115825:144"/> and ſo continueth, unleſſe it get back again, or fall into the Cavity of the Bladder. The Urine is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bloody by reaſon of the opening, Corroſion of the Veins, or cutting of the tender Fleſh of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; ſometimes it is thin and little in Quantity. Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Sand and Stones is an evident ſign of the Stone, but if the Patient voideth Gravell without ſtones, be not too haſty in your Judgment, but take the Caution given you in the 60 Chapter <hi>Of the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condriack Melancholy.</hi> The Thigh, on the ſame ſide the Back is pained, becometh numb; becauſe the Stone doth oppreſſe the Nerve, which is in the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Loyns under the Reins, and goeth to the Hip for its Motion. The Sick loatheth, and vomiteth often, by reaſon of the Connexion of the Kidneys with the Stomach; the Stomach (ſympathetically ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) endeavoureth to exclude that hurtful compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Be ſure you make a diſtinction between the Stone in the Kidneys, and the Chollick; have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the 43 Chapter, where I have left a few Rules.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is very dangerous, and bringeth many and ſad Symptoms, as Inflammations, Exulcerations, great Pains, long Watchings, Weakneſſe, Feavers, Suppreſſion of Urine, and Death it ſelf. It is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to cure (if not incurable) in old men, ſaith <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> with whom <hi>Experience</hi> agreeth. If the pain hath continued long and violent, and the Sick grow externally cold, with cold and faint Sweats, Death is at hand. If the Stone be accompanied with an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the Kidneys it is incurable, becauſe thoſe things which do break the Stone, do exaſperate the Ulcer.</p>
               <p>The Cure of the Stone in the Kidneys conſiſteth in mollifying, enlarging, or relaxing, and throwing the Stone out of the Ureters, to break the Stone if it be
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115825:144"/> too big for the Paſſage; to take away the antecedent Cauſe and to eaſe pain, which you muſt do thus: firſt, open the Liver-Vein on the ſame ſide, that is moſt grieved: draw as much Blood as the Conſtitution of the Patient can well ſpare. Then adminiſter a molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and laxative Cliſter: <hi>Take of Common and Marſh-Mallows, Camomill, Penny-royall, Pellitory of the Wall, and Violet Leavs, of each, one handfull: the Seeds of ſweet Fennell, Flax, and Faenugreek; of each, half an Ounce: boil it in Poſſet-drink to a Pint, ſtrain it, and diſſolve therein Caſſia, Catholicon, and Diaphaenicon, of each, three Drachms: the Oyls of Rue and Scorpions, of each, one Ounce: make a Clister and administer it.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Oyls of ſweet-Almonds, Camomill, Dill, Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, and Violets are good to be uſed in Cliſters of this Nature. This Cliſter, or one of the ſame Nature, you muſt give twice or thrice in a week; and, in the dayes between, foment the Region of the Kidneys with a Fomentation made of the aforenamed ſimples, or others of the like Nature, which I ſhall treat of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I put an end to this Chapter. Afterwards anoint the part with the Oyls aforenamed. Or you may make a Cataplaſm of white Bread ſodden in white Wine, and if you add any of the aforeſaid Oyls it will be the better. Afterwards lay a Plaiſter to the place; <hi>Take of the Oyl of Camomill and Rue, of each, half an Ounce: of Dill and ſweet-Almonds, of each, two Drachms: Gooſe and Hens Greaſe, of each, one Drachm: with Wax, and the compound Melilot Plaiſter, as much as ſufficeth, make a Plaiſter and apply it.</hi> In the mean time, you muſt not forget inward Medicines, which have a Faculty to break the Stone, to eaſe pain, and mollify and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Ureters. The ſimples following are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of, <hi>viz.</hi> the Roots of Aſparagus, Birthwort, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, Butchers-Broom, Filipendula, Couch-graſſe
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:115825:145"/> Garden and Horſe-radiſh, Maddir, Marſh and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Mallows, Liquoriſh, Onions, Parſly, Knot-graſs: the Leavs of Bettony, Camomill, Penny-royall, Marſh-Mallows, Pellitory of the Wall, Maiden-hair, Parſly peart, Filipendula, Saxifrage, Savin, Burnet, Goats-Thorne, Kidney-Wort, Melilot, Golden-Rod: the ſeeds of Nettles, Parſly, Gromwell, Burdock, Winter Cherryes, Bay, Ivy, and Juniper Berries, the four cold Seeds; the ſtones of Hips, Haws, Medlers, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Of theſe you may make Decoctions, Powders, or diſtilled Waters, and the like, the Deſcription of which (ſot brevity ſake) I will omit. <hi>Quercetanus,</hi> in his Diſpenſatory, commendeth this following Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; <hi>Take of the inward skins of Hen's, Gizzards, and their white Dung, of each, half an Ounce: the inward skins of Egg ſhels dried and powdered, two Ounces and an half: Rupture-wort and Cinnamon, of each, four Scruples: the Stones of Medlars, two Drachms: the Seeds of Anniſe and Fennell, of each one Ounce: powder them, and give half a Drachm or a Drachm in white-Wine.</hi> Goats Blood prepared is excellent: and the Water diſtilled from it in Balneo Mariae doth wonders. And ſome do commend the Urine of a Goat, taken out whilſt he is alive, and drunk, and the Entrails apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Chymiſts do highly extoll their Salts, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience tells us that if they be well prepared and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully adminiſtred, they work no ſmall effects: <hi>viz.</hi> the Salt of Bean Cods, or ſtalks of Camomill: Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar vitriolate: Oyl of Vitriol; the Spirit of Salt: Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius Dulcis, <hi>&amp;c. Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> commendeth the naturall Balſom, a few drops thereof, taken with Oyl of ſweet-Almonds. <hi>Crato</hi> had as good an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Filberts eaten, and confirms his opinion by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. Minerall Waters are good, for they do not onely diſſolve the ſlimy Tartarous Matter, which
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:115825:145"/> breeds the Stone; but alſo allayeth the hot Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Liver and Reins. Of all <hi>Diuretick</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, Turpetine is the ſafeſt, given the Quantity of a Nut with Sugar every Morning: for <hi>Diureticks</hi> taken very often (for the moſt part) hurt, by carrying the Humours from other parts to the Reins; but Turpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine ſeldom or never worketh any evill effect. You may uſe it thus: <hi>Take of Venice Turpetine, waſhed with Saxifrage Water, half an Ounce: Caſſia newly drawn, ſix Drachms: Ruharb and Liquoriſh in Powder, of each, half a Drachm; mix them and make a Bolus.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, give Cliſters often, or, if you ſee it more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, purge the Body between your Diuretick Potions, for the reaſon before given: your beſt Purgations are Caſſia, Diaphaenicon, Rubarb, and ſuch like. If the Liver and Reins are diſtempered by Heat, make uſe of thoſe Medicines preſcribed againſt the hot Diſtemper of the Liver. If Crudities in the Stomach be the Cauſe ſeek Medicines out of the Chapters which treat of the Diſeaſes of the Stomach. If you do carefully conſider the Cauſe, or from what part of the Body the Reins fetch their ſtony Materials, and order your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines accordingly, with prudence and reaſon, by the bleſſing of God, you may find the Cure of the Stone not to be ſo difficult, as it is commonly adjudged. For my part, I have cured ſeveral people, who have been grievouſly vexed with this Grief: for which Mercy I do and ſhall praiſe God.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LXIII. <hi>Of the Stone in the Bladder.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Shall ſpeak nothing of the Cauſe of the Stone in the Bladder; the material and efficient Cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame with that of the Reins. This Diſeaſe happeneth to Children, oftner then to people of riper Age, who are more ſubject to the Stone in the Reins: becauſe Children, eating much and often, their Urine is thick, and the expulſive Faculty in the Reins is ſtronger in them then in men, and ſendeth the Urine ſpeedily to the Bladder; where (being long kept by reaſon of much ſleep or play) the Urine ſettleth, and is retained till it by Heat becometh a Stone, for the paſſage is narrow in Children, and the Urine not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſharp, doth not powerfully provoke the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive Faculty. <hi>Fernelius</hi> was of an Opinion that the Stone in the Bladder was alwayes firſt bred in the Reins, and falling from thence into the Bladder, and getting freſh Matter, there encreaſeth: <hi>Fern: Lib.</hi> 6 <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>pag.</hi> 317. Many times it ſo happeneth: but daily Experience teacheth that many have the Stone in the Bladder, who never had pain in the Reins, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Children.</p>
               <p>The Knowledg of this Diſeaſe in the beginning is difficult; but when the Stone is grown great is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough, to the Patient's ſorrow. The firſt ſign is pain in the Neck of the Bladder, reaching to the end of the yard, eſpecially after piſſing. The yard itcheth and the Patient handleth it often. He fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a great Weight about the Neck of the Bladder,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:115825:146"/> when the Stone is grown great; the Urine ſuddenly ſtoppeth, and he is in pain, like a Woman in travel: his yard ſtandeth often, and he maketh Water with moſt eaſe lying upon his back, becauſe then the Stone falleth out of the Neck of the Bladder. When he hath need to make Water, he is alſo much provoked to goe to ſtool, by reaſon of the conſent of the Sphinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Muſcles of the Anus and Bladder, being moved by the Branches of the ſame Nerve. Many ſigns more I might inſert, but theſe I think ſufficient for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious; To be fully ſatisfyed, the beſt way is to make uſe of the <hi>Catheter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is alwayes exceeding painfull and no leſſe dangerous: if the Stone be like Flint it can never be diſſolved; if ſoft or brittle, it may be diſſolved by the long uſe of ſtrong Medicines: but ſew there are that have Patience enough to make uſe of ſo many Medicines. The Cure is not altogether ſo difficult in Women as in Men, becauſe the paſſage in them is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In the year 1656 I cured a Woman, who was a long time grieved with the Stone, and intended to venture upon the laſt and terrible Cure by Cutting; with in the ſpace of a Month, (having firſt diſſolved part of the Stone by Medicines) ſhe voided a Stone (without the help of manuall operation) in bigneſſe two Inches, in length an Inch and an half, without prejudice to the Uritery parts: ſhe was then aged 63, and is yet a live and luſty to praiſe God for ſo great a deliverance.</p>
               <p>For to perfect the Cure, you muſt do as you are taught in the foregoing Chapter, ſo that I need not here repeat any thing, onely lay down the Medicine ſo much commended by <hi>Horatius Augenius;</hi> it is thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared: <hi>Take of Sows or Wood Lice prepared, a Drachm, or four Scruples: Aqua vitae, two Scruples: the Broth
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:115825:147"/> of red Cicers, nine or ten Ounces; take it in the Morning fasting. Sennertus</hi> alſo commends it, and this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine likewiſe, <hi>Take of Salt of white Tartar one Ounce: Parſly water, one Pint; mix them, and ſtrain them with a brown paper.</hi> If, after the uſe of Medicines, you find the Neck of the Bladder wounded, or much pained by the roughneſſe of the Stone, make a Decoction thus: <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſh Mallows, Fennel, Cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſſe, and Cammock, of each, one Ounce: Liquoriſh, two Drachms: Camomill and Saxifrage, of each, one Pugill: Winter Cherryes, twenty: Red Cicers, four Ounces: Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Sun, two Ounces: the four great cold Seeds, a Drachm and an half: French Barly four Ounces: boil them gently in the diſtilled Water of Saxifrage, Cammock, and Parſly, of each, half a Pint; when it hath boiled a while, add half a Pint of white Wine, and let it boil till half be conſumed: to the ſtraining, add ſix Ounces of the Sirrup of Marſh-Mallows; drink three or four Ounces in the Morning.</hi> To the Region of the Bladder muſt be applyed mollifying and aſſwaging Fomentations. If all Medicines fail, and the Patient's pains unſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, Neceſſity requireth the dangerous Operation of Cutting. Let the Phyſitian prepare the Patient's body by Purging, Bleeding, and Diet, according to the Conſtitution and Condition of the Patient's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and let the Patient prepare his Soul for God.</p>

Things preternatural may be the Cauſe, as a Stroak, Wound, or Bruiſe upon the Reins or Bladder; conſtant Feavers; the Matter of the Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy, or Empyema carried away by the Urine: Heat or Stoppage of the Urine, the Stone, or Exulceration of the part may cauſe an Inflammation.</p>
               <p>The Inflammation of the Reins is known by thoſe Signes, a weighty and beating Pain about the part, which extendeth it ſelf to the adjacent parts, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient cannot help himſelf, nor ly otherwiſe then upon his back: If he doth ſneez or move his Body the pain encreaſeth, he hath a Numbneſſe in the Leg on the ſame ſide, he maketh Water with difficulty: he hath a conſtant ſharp Feaver, with Watchings, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and dangerous Symptomes: He vomiteth Choller, Phlegm, and other Humours; the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is, firſt, thin and yellow, afterwards, thick and red.</p>

And if you open the inferior Veins, it is a good derivation. Then give the Cliſter again, and as often as need requireth? but remember to give it in a ſmall quantity, leaſt it oppreſſe the Tumor. Uſe Cupping and Scarifying; Frictions and Ligatures to the extream parts, to draw the Humours outwards.

               <p>This Diſeaſe is known by the voiding of much Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the Urine. To know whether the Reins or the Bladder be diſeaſed, take a few Rules; If the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer be in the Reins, the pain is there, the Matter is
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115825:149"/> more concocted, more in quantity, and more mixed with the Urine, making it appear like Milk, which, ſtanding, ſettleth to the bottom; ſometimes much Blood is voided, and pieces of Fleſh, which ſometimes ſtops the Paſſage. When the Ulcer is in the Bladder, contrary Signes appear, the pain is neer the Privityes, the Matter is leſſe in Quantity, and not well concoct, but of divers Colours, and ſtinketh; ſometimes Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is voided without Urine: If the Ulcer be old, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and hard, ſnotty Phlegm is voided, ſuch as is voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if there be a Stone in the Bladder; for the moſt part, little Skins, like Scales or Bran, are voided.</p>
               <p>As all inward Vlcers are dangerous, ſo are theſe much more, becauſe the continuall Flux of Humours, with the Vrine, to the part, doth nouriſh the Vlcer. The Violence of the pain cauſeth Watchings and a Conſumption of the whole Body. If the Vicer be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in time and the Patient yong, it may be cured, elſe not.</p>
               <p>The Cure muſt be performed by evacuating the peccant Humours, by cleanſing, drying, and healing the Vlcer. You muſt parge the Humours, which flow to the part affected, with gentle Medicines, ſuch as are preſcribed in the Chapter aforegoing. If there be Repletion or Inflammation in the part, let Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my be uſed. Evacuate the Humours by gentle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, mentioned in the Chapter aforegoing. <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Dulcis</hi> doth cleanſe and heal the Vlcer. Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine is a good cleanſer. It is good for the Patient to vomit often. After due Evacuations, you muſt uſe cleanſers: as the Milk of Cows, Goats, or Aſſes, which are very good, and cleanſe with their wheyie part, and heal with their cheezie, but give it not in a Feaver. Let the Patient drink Water and Sugar, thin Hydromell, or Barly Water. In Hydromell, if
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:115825:149"/> there be a Feaver, boil the cold Seeds, Mallows, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoriſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Waters that ſpring from Allum and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Mines are good, for they correct the Heat, and cleanſe the Ulcer. The Decoction of China, Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, Sarſaparilla, and the like, is good to dry up the Humours, to purge the crude Matter, in them that have the French Pox, and have no Feaver, nor Flux of Blood. But leſt the Bowels ſhould be inflamed, give cooling Broths at Night. After the uſe of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, (you may ſee, by the Vrine, when the Vlcer is cleanſed; <hi>viz.</hi> when it appeareth white and clean without any dreggy or filthy Matter,) then you muſt give aſtringing, glutinating, and healing Medicines. <hi>Take of Conſerve of Roſes, four Ounces: Bolearmenick, Terra Sigillata, red Coral, and Sanguis Draconis, of each, two Drachms: the Seeds of Lettice, Purſlane, and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, of each, one Drachm; red Roſes, and Shavings of Ivory, of each, two Scruples: with Sirrup of Comphry, make an Opiate.</hi> Or you may make of it a Maſſe for Pills with Venice Turpentine, or (if that cauſe pain) with the Juyce of Liquoriſh. Chymiſts do much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>Antimonium Diaphoreticum, Mercurius Dulcis, &amp; Diaphoreticus.</hi> To allay the vehemency of the pain, you muſt ſometimes mix Anodines with your Medicines, as Laudanum, the Sirrup of Poppyes, and the Emulſion of the cold Seeds. Outwardly foment the Region of the Kidneys, thus: <hi>Take of Camomil, Mallows, Melilot, Pellitory of the Wall, and Violets, of each, one Handfull: the Roots of Marſh-Mallows, and water-Lillyes, of each, two Ounces: the Seeds of Flax, Fenugreek, and Winter-Cherryes, of each, three Drachms: make a Decoction and foment the part.</hi> Then apply this Liniment: <hi>Take of the Oyl of Violets and Sweet Almonds, of each, one Ounce and an half: Oyl of Roſes, one Ounce: of the Muſilage made of the Seeds of Marſh-Mallows and Fenugreck, of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:115825:150"/> each, two Ounces: Saffron, one Scruple; make a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> If the Ulcer be in the Bladder, you muſt make an Injection twice in a day, with new Milk, Whey, Hydromel, or Barly Water with Hony of Roſes, to cleanſe; afterwards add Aſtringers and Driers, as <hi>the white Trochts of Rhaſis or of Gordonius:</hi> or boil in Whey or Barly-water, the Roots of Comphry, Allum, Mirth, Tragacanth, and the like.</p>

                  </gap>, <hi>Diabetes</hi> is a quick and plentifull making of Water, after which followeth violent Thirſt, and a waſting of the whole Body. The Cauſe of this Diſeaſe is a hot Diſtemper of the Reins, which draweth Water violently from the Veins, which cauſeth a great Thirſt after drink, which, as ſoon as it is taken, is carried to the Reins; where burthening the retentive Faculty and provoking the expulſive, it is ſoon ſent to the Bladder.

Others will not admit of this opinion, becauſe the Kidneys onely ſuffer in this Diſeaſe; and that Choller, and other burnt Humours, are firſt bred in the Liver. They ſay there is a venemous Quality bred in the Kidneys; <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf is of this opinion, that divers kinds of Poiſons may breed in the Body of Man.

               <p>The Signes of this Diſeaſe are clear, from what hath been ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> An unquenchable Thirſt, an extraordinary Piſſing, and voiding the Drink as ſoon (almoſt) as it is drunk; and a Decay of the whole Body.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is deadly, if it be not taken in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and the Patient yong, for it brings a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
               <p>If you judge the Patient curable, you muſt labour to allay the hot Diſtemper of the Kidneys; to correct their poyſonous Quality; to thicken the Humours which flow to them, and to ſtrengthen them. Firſt, give mollifying and aſſwaging Cliſters, and purge, if you ſee occaſion, as you are taught in the Chapter <hi>Of the Inflammation of the Kidneys.</hi> Gentle Vomits do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuate and draw the Humours from the Ureters. If nothing forbid, open a Vein in the Arm. To correct the Diſtemper and thicken the Humours, make a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lep, thus: <hi>Take of the diſtilled Water (or the Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) of Plantane, four Ounces: of Lettice, Poppy, and Purſlane, of each, two Ounces: the Sirrup of Myrtles, Comphry, and Quinces, of each, one Ounce: the Sirrup of Poppyes, half an Ounce: the Spirit of Vitriol, twenty Drops; mix them and make a Julep.</hi> If you will have a Medicine more aſtringent or binding, thus: <hi>Take of the Seeds of Plantane, Purſlane, and Coriander prepared, of each, one Ounce: the Flowers of red Roſes, Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats, and yellow Mirabolans, of each, half an Ounce: Nutmegs, half a Drachm: Corall and Pearl prepared, burnt Harts Horn, Bolearmenick, and the Roots of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentill, of each, one Scruple; make them into Powder:</hi>

               <p>THis Diſeaſe conſiſteth in the hurting of the reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Action of the Bladder. Some are ſubject to this Diſtemper, while they are awake, which is the worſt. Others are ſubject to it ſleeping onely, which is not ſo bad, becauſe then the animall Functions are leſſe excerciſed. There are two Cauſes of this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; Firſt, the Weakneſſe and Looſeneſſe of the Sphincter Muſcle of the Bladder. Or Secondly, the exquiſite Senſe of the Bladder, and the Sharpneſſe of the Urine, (which ſtirreth up the expulſive Faculty) with conſent of the Will. The firſt Cauſe is apparent in ſucking Children, weak people, and ſuch whoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Heat is decayed, and the Body oppreſſed with cold and moiſt Humours. The other Cauſe you may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:115825:151"/> in thoſe, whoſe Bladder nor Sphincter is no ways diſtempered, but they imagine (when the Quantity and Sharpneſſe of the Vrine ſtirreth up the expulſive Faculty) that they are piſſing againſt the Wall, and ſo get a cuſtome of it, which cannot be cured by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. The Sphincter Muſcle may become weak or looſe, by Youth, old Age, decay of vitall Heat, by the Palſy; in Women, from Diſeaſes of the Womb, or hard Labour, cutting for the Stone, or any Wound there, or deep Vlcer.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is eaſily known, and the cauſe thereof is as eaſily diſcovered; if it come by Wound, Vlcer, old Age, or the like, it is apparent. If it come by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of other parts, the Diſeaſes of thoſe parts are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious as the original: If neither of them appear, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the cold and moiſt Temper of the part, which is known by the internall and external cauſes, and the Effects upon them depending, as Softneſſe of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Whiteneſſe, and Looſeneſſe of the Nervs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the privityes, Childhood, Age, evill phlegmatick Concoction, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>In old Men this Diſeaſe is incurable, becauſe the vitall Hant cannot be repaired. In Children Nature worketh the cure, when they grow elder, by drying up the ſuperfluous Humidity, and knitting the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; but if a man continue ſo till the Age of twenty or twenty five, he is incurable. If involuntary Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing come to a man ſick of an acute Feaver, Death is at hand.</p>
               <p>If this Diſeaſe come by a Wound or Vlcer or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſt Diſeaſe, the cure depends upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of them; otherwiſe the cure is wrought by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the cold and moiſt Diſtemper and the Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Sphincter Muſcle. Firſt, you muſt purge the cold and phlegmatick Humours; add to your
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:115825:152"/> phlegm-Purgers ſuch Medicines, which purge and leav a binding Quality behind it, as Rubarb, Myrabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans, and the like. Then give Medicines that knit the part and dry the Humours: <hi>Take of the Roots of Comphry, and Cypreſſe, of each, half an Ounce: Cypreſſe-Nuts, and Myrtles dryed, of each, two Drachms: Corian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Seed prepared, red Corall, Amber, and Shavings of Ivory, of each, one Drachm: the Seeds of Plantane, Rue, and Acorn cups, of each, two Scruples: powder them, and with the Sirrup of Comphry, make an Opiate, and give the Quantity of a cheſnut Morning and Evening: or drink half a Drachm of the powder in red Wine.</hi> Sweating Medicines are much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended. Things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the cure of this Diſeaſe are, the Brain and Stones of a Hare burnt: the Throat of a Cock; Snails and Egg ſhells; Mice fryed or dryed to powder; Hogs Hoofs powdered; Agrimony and the Gizzards of Hens in powder. Apply Medicines to the Privityes, that are hot, ſtrengthning, and aſtringing. Let him drink the Decoction of the inward Bark of an Oak, of Sloes, and ſuch like; and let him avoid drink to bedward. You muſt allay the Symptomes which may accompany this Diſeaſe, as Feavers, Thirſt, Watchings, Conſumptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the Remedies laid down in their proper chapters.</p>

                  <hi>Iſcuria</hi> is when the Urine is totally ſtopped: when lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is voided then it is called <hi>Stranguria.</hi> The firſt is cauſed by an Obſtruction in the Nerv, which helpeth the expulſive Faculty of the Bladder, by the Palſy, or ſome ſleepy or ſtupifying Diſeaſe. A cold Diſtemper of the Bladder, dulling the Senſe thereof, may be the Cauſe. Sometimes an Inflammation or Tumor in the Muſcle of the Bladder may ſtop the Paſſage, the Stone, ſome thick humor, clod of Blood, or the like. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by long holding of Water, by which the Bladder is ſo ſtretched that it cannot contract it ſelf to open the Paſſage. Sometimes the Bladder is empty, &amp; no Urine cometh to it, this is called a baſtard <hi>Iſcuria,</hi> and may be cauſed, by ſome hurt in the attractive or expulſive Faculty of the Roins. The attractive Faculty is hure by ſome Stoppage in the Reins, or emulgent Veins. The Reins may be obſtructed by the Stone, thick Phlegm, or the like; the emulgent Veins, by abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Blood or Water. Sometimes the watry hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is ſpent, as in Feavers; or ſent to ſome other part, as in the Dropſy; by which means the attractive Faculty of the Reins is hindered. The expulſive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Reins is hindered by the Stone, Phlegm, or clods of Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diag:</hi> The Diſeaſe is eaſily known; the Cauſes thereof may be obtained. If it come by long holding the Urine, the Patient is able to inform you. If there be a ſtoppage in the part, the uſe of the Catheter or fearing Candle, and the ingenuity of the Artiſt, will diſcover the Nature of the ſtoppage. If the Paſſage be ſtopped by the Stone, the Symptoms of the Stone have gone before; If a Caruncle, there hath gone before a <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> or an Vlcerin the paſſage of the Yard. If clods of Blood ſtop the Paſſage, the Patient hath formerly voided Blood, and clotted Blood will ſtick to the Catheter.</p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:115825:153"/>
               <p>The Strangury is thus known, there is neither Weight, Tumor, or Extenſion about the Privityes, but rather an Emptineſſe; the attractive or expulſive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Reins is obſtructed as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Prognoſticks are thus made; This Diſeaſe is ever dangerous, if it continue above ſeven dayes it is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The ſame judge, if the Patient hath Hiccough or Tenaſmus accompanying this Diſeaſe: or if it came by a Wound or Blow upon the back-bone; or if his Breath ſtink of Piſſe. The Cure of both theſe conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in removing the Cauſes. If it proceed from the fullneſſe of the emulgent Veins, bleeding is good: if from Diſeaſes of the Reins or Ureters, ſeek the Cure out of the Chapters, that treat of the Pain, Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Stone in the Kidneys. If it depend upon the Inflammation of the Bladder, ſee the 64 Chapter. If upon the Stone faſtned in the Neck of the Bladder, lay the Patient upon his back, with his Thighs lifted up, move him hither and thither till the Stone fall out of the Paſſage; if that will not do, make uſe of the <hi>Catheter.</hi> If the Stone lyeth in the Paſſage of the Yard, bathe the Yard in warm Milk or Oyl, &amp; labour to get it out with your fingers: if it will not come out; bind the Yard on each ſide, and make an Inciſion on the upper ſide of the Yard. If a Caruncle ſtop the Paſſage; Medicines, which are proper to take it away, muſt be conveyed to the part with a Wax-Candle. If Phlegm obſtruct, purge it with Medicines conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and when you ſee occaſion, give ſuch as provoke Urine. The Chapters of the Stone of the Bladder or Kidneys will direct you how to prepare them, as alſo Cliſters, Fomentations, Unguents, and the like.</p>

                  </gap>, <hi>Dyſuria</hi> in Greek is a Diſeaſe which modern Writers call, <hi>Scalding of the Urine:</hi> it differs from <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guria</hi> in this, that more Water is made, and with farr more pain. Any thing that can wound the Sphincter-Muſcle, or paſſage of the Bladder, may be the Cauſe. The uſuall Cauſe is either a mixture of ſharp Humours with the Urine, or ſometimes, the ſharpneſſe of the Urine, cauſed by the eating of hot and ſharp Meats, or by the hot Diſtemper of the Bowels, Liver, or other parts: or from evill Concoction in the Stomach or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by which the Blood is not freed from ſalt and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarous Humours, which, being ſucked to the Kidneys, is ſent to the Bladder, &amp; cauſeth pain. Filthy Matter, comming from an Ulcer in the Reins or Bladder, may be the Cauſe; he who is troubled with a <hi>Gonorrhaea</hi> or <hi>Running of the Reins,</hi> is ſeldom free from ſcalding U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine. To conclude, the Stone or large Gravel may be the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The Knowledge of this Diſeaſe is evident, the Signes of the Cauſes are eaſily gathered. If it be cauſed by the Stone, Inflammation, or <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> it is known by their proper Signes. If from ſharpneſſe of Urine, by the mixture of Humours, the Urine will be thin, and high coloured; or in it will appear a mixture of Choller, Phlegm, or Matter; the Patient hath eaten hot things, or elſe hath ſome hot Diſtemper.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is not very dangerous, unleſſe it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long, and ulcerateth the Neck of the Bladder:
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:115825:154"/> Sometimes it is hard to be cured, eſpecially, if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be old.</p>
               <p>The Cure muſt be wrought by taking away the Cauſe: If a mixture of ſharp Humours make the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine ſharp, firſt make uſe of Phlebotomy, which is good to correct the hot Diſtemper of the Liver and other parts, make uſe of this Evacuation as often as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's Conſtitution will bear, and the Diſtemper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; then, to derive it from the part affected, open the lower Veins. Then purge with Caſſia, Manna, Rubarb, Mirabolans, Tamarinds, and ſuch things, which purge gently: if you give it with the Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Plantane, Mallows, Lettice, Purſlane, and the like, it will be the better. A gentle Vomit is much commended as a good Revulſion. Cooling Cliſters are good. Inwardly the Whey of Goats milk, or Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waters that cool, are good for ordinary drink. Or this Julep: <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſh and common Mallows, of each, one Ounce: Lettice, Endive, Purſlane and Violet Leavs, of each, one Handfull: Jujubes and Sebestens, of each one Ounce: of the four great cold Seeds, a Drachm: the flowers of Violets, Roſes, and water-Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, of each, one Pugil: boil them in Spring Water to a Pint and an half; ſtrain it, and add of Jujubes, Violets, and Poppyes, of each, one Ounce and an half; Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, twenty Drops: make a Julep for four Doſes, to be taken Morning and Evening.</hi> If there be no Feaver, give Milk by it ſelf. The Troches of Winter Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes is good. If the pain be very great, let the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, when he maketh Water, put his Yard into warm Milk, or a Decoction of Mallows, and other cooling Herbs. Or inject Milk, Plantane-Water, or an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulſion of the cold Seeds, into the Paſſage.

                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:115825:154"/> the Oyl or Unguent of Roſes, Oyl of Lillyes, and the like, it profiteth. If the Liver, Reins, or other parts by their Heat be the Cauſe, uſe Medicines that are good to cool them. If the Liver be too hot, bleed the Haemorrhoids, or make an Iſſue in the right Leg. If it come from the Stone, Inflammation, or Vlcer of the Bladder or Kidneys, cure them according to the Rules in their proper Chapters; but the cooling Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, before mentioned, are good to allay the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes.</p>

               <p>This Diſeaſe is apparent to the Senſes, for when Blood is mixed with the Vrine, it appeareth like Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein Fleſh hath been waſhed, with Clods of Blood at the bottom: if it ſtayes too long in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it looks black. The place that is pained ſhews the part affected. If it come from the Reins, it is
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115825:155"/> more mixed with the Urine, then if it come from the Bladder. If it come from the Bladder, it is in a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Quantity. If it come from the Stone in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys or Bladder, the Signes mentioned in their proper Chapters will appear. If it come from Repletion or Sharpneſſe of Humours, the Abundance of Blood, Choller, Melancholy, or ſuch Humours appear in the Body. If it come by a Blow, Fall, violent Exerciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Patient is able to inform.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe, if it be violent and continue long, is very dangerous; for ſometimes the Patient falleth into a Conſumption, ſometimes into the Dropſy: Sometimes it cauſeth a Stoppage of Urine, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an Vlcer breedeth in the place from whence the Blood Floweth.</p>
               <p>If Blood or ſharp Humours abound, begin the Cure with blood-letting; after a while, for derivation, let the Haemorrhoids and the <hi>Saphaena</hi> or Ancle-Vein be opened. Then purge the chollerick Humours with thoſe Medicines that are preſcribed in the 30 Chapter <hi>Of Spitting of Blood.</hi> After you have purged ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, give things that knit the Veins and ſtop Blood. For this purpoſe give four or five Ounces of the Juyce of Plantane, and a Scruple of the Troches of Amber, or of Gordonius, Morning and Evening. <hi>Foreſtus</hi> in his Obſervations doth much commend Sheeps Milk; ſix Ounces, with one Drachm of Bolearmenick, is the Doſe. The Decoction of Knot-graſſe, Purſlane, Horſe-Tail, Comphry roots, Plantane, Pomgranats, Quinces, and the like. Likewiſe the Powder of red Coral, Blood-Stone, Sanguis Draconis, Terra Sigilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, given with the Water or Juyce of Plantane is good. Giye cooling Juleps to allay the Heat of the Blood. Apply ſuch things to the Loins as cool and aſtringe, thus: <hi>Take of the Roots of Biſtort, Comphry, and Clowns-Wound-Wort,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:115825:155"/> of each, one Ounce: Horſe-Tail, Plantane Purſlane, Knot graſſe, and Shepherds purſe, of each, one Handfull: Pomgranate peels, half an Ounce; Sumach, Myrtle Berryes, and Hypocyſtis, of each, two Drachms: Acorn cups, red and yellow Sanders, of each, one Drachm: red Roſes, three pugils: boil them in Smith's Water, and Vinegar, therewith ſoment the Reins.</hi> Then anoint the Loins with <hi>Unguentum Comitiſſae,</hi> and <hi>Refrigerans Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni;</hi> and if you would have it bind more, add the juyce of Plantane, or ſuch like, Sanguis Draconis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then wear a thin plate of Lead, about the Reins, pricked full of holes. Let the Patient's ordinary drink, be Beer, in which is tunned Maſtick-wood ſliced and cut ſmall, Plantane, and the Herbs before named. If the Liver be diſtempered with Heat, conferr with the 53 Chapter. If the Stone or Gravell be the Cauſe, uſe no ſtrong <hi>Diureticks,</hi> becauſe they provoke the Flux, but that which I have known very effectuall in this caſe, I ſhal here commend, and put an end to the Chapter: <hi>Take of the four greater and leſſer cold Seeds, of each, one Drachm: Quince Seeds, half a Drachm: the Seeds of Marſh-Mallows, white Poppy and Winter Cherryes, of each, one Scruple; make an Emulſion with the Decoction of Marſh-Mallows, and give two, three, or four spoonſuls in the Morning, and if you add a little Oyl of Vitrioll, it will be the better.</hi> Venice Turpetine, made into Pills with the Powder of Rubarb, half a Drachm taken in the Morning doth gently cleanſe the Reins.</p>

               <p>THis Diſeaſe is called by ſome, the Virgins Diſeaſe, the white Feaver, the white Jaundice, but vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly the Green-ſickneſſe. It is an evill habit of the Body, proceeding from the Obſtruction of the Veins about the Womb, Liver, Spleen, and Meſentery, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a heavineſſe &amp; unweildineſſe of the whole Body, difficulty of Breathing, panting of the Heart, and Head-Ach, a deſire after Food that is evil, and a loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of good. The Veins about the Womb being obſtructed, that Blood, which Nature hath ordained to go thither, having not free paſſage, runs upwards, and oppreſſeth the Heart, Liver, Spleen, Diaphrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, ſtops the Veſſels, and deſtroys the naturall Heat; hence it cometh to paſſe that the Stomach and Bowels cannot concoct well as they ought to do, ſo Crudityes are diſperſed throughout the body, and make an evill Habit. Sometimes, by this means, the Hypocondria is ſwelled, which depreſſing the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> cauſeth Shortneſſe of Breath. This groſſe Blood being carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the great Artery to the Heart, which, leaſt it ſhould be ſuffocated by it, labours for its deliverance, &amp; often moving of its Arteryes, cauſeth a Palpitation, and Beating of the Temples. The Stomach, by this means, being filled with Crudityes and excrementiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humours, cauſeth a Loathing of Food, and a deſire after ſuch things, which ought not to be eaten, as Salt, Chalk, Coals, Aſhes, Oat-meal, Wheat, Tobacco-Pipes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Diſeaſe is called <hi>Pica Malacia,</hi> and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:115825:156"/> we have ſpoken of it <hi>in the</hi> 35 <hi>Chapter of this Book.</hi> This Obſtruction is cauſed many wayes, as drinking cold Drink to Bedward; eating raw or unripe Fruits: Some go to Feaſts, and upon a full Stomach, dancing and ſporting all Night, diſturb the naturall Frame of the Body, and want Reſt: others ſleep too much, and ſit long at their work, as Seamſters, Bonelace-makers, and the like. By theſe and the like means, Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is hurt, the naturall Heat is extinguiſhed, and the Body filled with crude Excrements and thick ſlimy Humours, which cauſe Obſtructions.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is eaſily known, and you may know the diſeaſed, if you do but veiw their Faces, which are pale and white, ſometimes of a Lead colour, blew or green, the Face and Eye-lids, the Legs and Feet, ſwelled. The whole Body is unweildy and lazy. When the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is ſtirred by Exerciſe, or Walking, eſpecially going up a hill or ſteep place, there followeth Palpitation of the Heart, and Shortneſſe of Breath, Beating in the Temples, and great Head-Ach; behind, if the Womb be obſtructed, before, if the Hypocondria be afflicted: there is great loathing of wholeſome Meat, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the contrary: the Pulfe is ſwift and quick as in a Feaver, and when the Diſeaſe comes to the hight, the Terms are ſtopped.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe continueth a long time, yet is ſeldom dangerous; ſometimes, by long continuance, it breeds Corruption in the naturall parts, Dropſyes, Feavers, Conſumptions, which end in Death. If the Veins of the Womb onely are obſtructed, a Husband will cure her. Women, that have a long time been in this condition, bring forth weak and ſickly Children, and ſometimes they are barren.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is cured by opening the Obſtructions, evacuating the filthy Humours, and ſtrengthning of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:115825:157"/> the parts. The Obſtructions are opened, by ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines as are mentioned in the cure of the Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Liver and Spleen; you may add to them ſuch things which reſpect the Womb, as Mugwort, Fetherfew, Pennyroyall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the Spleen be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, add ſuch things which are proper for that, as Caper-bark, Ceterack, Spleenwort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Open the <hi>Saphaena</hi> or Ancle-Vein, but firſt, if the Maid be full of Blood, open a Vein in the Arm. Then purge often with ſuch Medicines as are preſcribed in the Cure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed: and make uſe of ſuch Medicines as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully open Obſtructions there preſcribed. <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> doth much commend the Conſerve of Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, given thirty dayes together, drinking after it a little of the diſtilled Water of Savin, in which Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb hath been infuſed. The Salt of Mugwort is very good, and <hi>Faecula Brioniae,</hi> mixed with the Conſerve, hath an effectuall and powerfull operation. If the Obſtructions are ſtubborn and not eaſily opened, make a Bath, thus: <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſh-Mallows, Briony, Elder, and Lillyes, of each, two pound: Balm, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſew, Mallows, Mercury, Maddir, Mugmort, Nep, Pennyrorall, and Violets, of each, three Handfulls: the Seed of Flax and Fenugreek, of each, two Ounces; boil them in a ſufficient. Quantity of Water, and let the Patient bathe her ſelf in the Morning and Evening, two dayes, &amp; let the Decoction be renewed the ſecond day.</hi> The next day, open the Vein under the Ancle, if the Terms be ſtopped, (as, for the moſt part, they are in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,) then give Medicines that powerfully open Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions: when you find that the Obſtructions are opened, which you may eaſily perceive by the decay of the aforenamed Symptoms, then you muſt diſcuſſe the peccant Humours, that remain in the Veins and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the Body, by Sweats; for which you muſt
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:115825:157"/> uſe the Decoction of Guajacum in cold conſtitutions; or of China and Sarfa in thoſe that are hot. In the mean while, every fourth or fifth day, give a purge to cleanſe the Body of the crude Humours, which cannot be ſent forth by Sweat.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MEnſium Suppreſſio</hi> or the Terms ſtopped, is when a Woman of ripe Age, hath little or no Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Blood by the Womb, once in a Month, yet gives not ſuck, nor is with Child. Divers Diſeaſes of the Womb may cauſe this Suppreſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> A cold and dry Diſtemper, which thickneth and bindeth the Womb. A hot and dry Diſtemper dryeth the part. Inflammation, Tumor, Ulcer, or Eroſion of the mouths of the Veſſels in Abortion; or Tumor in the adjacent parts, by compreſſion, may cauſe this Stoppage. The Veſſels of the Womb may be obſtructed by thick and phlegmatick Humours, or they may be compreſſed by a Tumor in the parts adjacent. The cauſe may be in the Blood, when it offends in Quantity, Quality, or Motion; in Quantity, when there is too much Blood, which doth ſo dilate the Veſſels, that they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract to expell it: too little, when the Body hath not enough for its Nouriſhment. It offendeth in Quality, when the Blood is thick, ſlimy, and viſcuous, by ſome cold Diſtemper of the Liver, or by the mixture of ſuch Humours with the Blood. It offends in Motion, when it flows ſome other way, as by the Haemorrhoids, by Urine, the Noſe, Vomiting, and by Spitting, and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115825:158"/> many other wayes. <hi>Riverius</hi> ſaith, that he ſaw a Maid which had a ſore Head which opened once a month and bled plentifully, and I know a Maid in the ſame Condition at this time.</p>
               <p>Externall cauſes are, taking cold in the time of the Flux: eating things of a very hot Nature, by which the Subſtance of the Liver is dryed: or Food that is cold, thick, and aſtringent, eſpecially, at the time of Purgation, eating too much or too little: by too long retaining of Excrements; by bleeding at the Noſe, or any unnatural Evacuation by Vomit, Seige, Urine, or Sweat. To theſe add the externall Cauſes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Chapter aforegoing <hi>Of the Green-Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is known by the Patient's Relation, but it is convenient to diſtinguiſh between this kind of Suppreſſion, and that which is common to Women with Child. They who have their Menſtrues thus ſtopped, are pale and more diſcoloured, then thoſe who are with Child. They who are in this condition, the longer it continues, the more the Symptoms en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; the contrary you ſhall find in Women with Child. They are likewiſe more ſad and melancholy then thoſe, who are with Child. In theſe the lower Belly, though it ſwell, yet it is not ſo hard nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Womb. And, Laſtly, an expert Midwife may diſtinguiſh it by the mouth of the Womb; for in theſe the mouth of the Womb is not ſo cloſe ſhut, as in a Woman with Child, but rather hard and painfull.</p>
               <p>More particularly, the Stoppage of the Veſſels of the Womb are known by a pain in the Loins, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the Terms ſhould flow, and if any thing iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it will be white, or blackiſh and ſlimy. If the parts adjacent be obſtructed, the Veins in the Thighs &amp;
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:115825:158"/> Arms, by abundance of Blood, are ſwollen: eſpecially, if the Woman be fleſhy, plethorick, and hath fed high. Or elſe the Woman wanteth Blood. Or the Blood is corrupted, which you may perceive by the evill habit of the Body, and ſome Diſeaſe of the Liver. If the Blood hath a praepoſterous Motion, or flow ſome other way, it is manifeſt.</p>
               <p>The Stoppage of the Terms is very dangerous, and many (I had almoſt ſaid, all) Diſeaſes may come thereof. It is leſt dangerous if it come by reaſon of too much Blood. It is worſt, which cometh by Streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Veſſels, or crude and ſlimy Humours, which obſtruct them.</p>
               <p>The Cure conſiſteth in this generally; If too much Blood be the cauſe, abate the Quantity by Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, firſt, in the Arm, then in the lower Veins. Then, by Fomentations, ſoften and relax the parts about the Womb; and give ſuch Purges as do properly provoke the Terms. If you find that Want of Blood is the cauſe of the Obſtruction, uſe Reſtoratives in the firſt place, and whatever you find to be the cauſe of Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, let that be removed; and if you find a praepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Motion of the Blood, labour to repell it, and drive it to the Paſſage of the Womb. But ſeeing that (for the moſt part) this Obſtruction is in the Veins of the Womb, you may follow the ſame Rule in cure, preſcribed, in the Chap: <hi>Of the Green ſickneſſe,</hi> adding ſuch things which more eſpecially reſpect the Womb. Purge thus: <hi>Take of Aloes, three Drachms: the Maſſe of Cochy Pills, one Drachm; with the Juyce of Savin (or Sirrup of Mugwort) make twenty Pills; and give three in the Morning every third day.</hi> Emollient Cliſters are likewiſe of great uſe. After Phlebotomy, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent purging, give ſuch things as powerfully open Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, ſuch as are preſcribed in the cure of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:115825:159"/> of the Liver and Spleen: to theſe add Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines made of the Roots of Aſparagus, Parſly, Fennel, Smallage, Maddir, Elicampane, Birth-Wort, Angelica, Cyperus; the leavs of Wormwood, Calamint, Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill, Origan, Southern-wood, Mugwort, Pennyroyall, Hyſſop, Hore-Hound, Rue, Motherwort, Sage, Fether-few, Maiden-hair, Nep, and Savin: the ſeeds of Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, Parſly, Fennel, Juniper, Bayes, Annis, Cummin, Nettles, and ſuch like; of theſe may be made Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or diſtilled Waters, Sitrups, and the like, which I omit, fearing my Book will ſwell to a farr bigger vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume then I intended. Of theſe or ſuch like you may make a Bath for the Patient to ſit in, afterwards anoint the Share, &amp; parts about the Privities, with the Oyl of Dill, Rue, Lillyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You may, likewiſe, make dry Suffumigations, with Caſtor, Storax, Galbanum, Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon, Frankincenſe, Bdellium, Benzoins, Lignum Aloes, Cloves, and Mace. Or you may make Peſſaries, with the maſſe of Cochy pills, &amp; Hony, and the Juyce of Mercury. Or with Hiera Picra, and Benedicta Laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva, with the Hony and Juyce aforeſaid: but this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that Peſſaryes muſt be applyed to married Women onely. If the Diſeaſe be inveterate, let Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues be made in the Legs, and after the menſtrual Flux is obtained, let them be dryed up again.</p>

                  <hi>Menſium Fluxus Immodicus,</hi> is when the monthly Terms do exceed in Quantity, come too often, or ſtay too long. This is cauſed by an opening of the Veins, either by Abundance, Heat, Sharpneſſe, or Thinneſſe of the Blood, or by ſome Blow, Fall, or
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:115825:159"/> Wound: to underſtand the Cauſe more fully, have recourſe to the 19 and 30 Chapters, <hi>Of bleeding at the Noſe, and ſpitting of Blood.</hi> The Diſeaſe it ſelf may be known by the Patient's information, and the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms which follow, <hi>viz.</hi> decay of Strength and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, an ill habit of the Body, by reaſon of ill Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Swelling of the Legs, and a Leady coloured Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. To know the Cauſes, obſerve, that a thin habit of the Body, with a Diet, which doth encreaſe thin and wheyiſh Blood; or you may perceive the thin and wheyiſh Humours in the Blood, which cometh from the Patient, this ſheweth that the Blood ſoaketh thorough the Veins. If the Coats or Ends of the Veins be broken, the Patient hath had ſoule Wound, Bruiſe, or Fall, or uſed ſome immoderate Labour, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſe, or Venery; hath indured too great Heat or Cold: or ſhe hath had a hard bargain in Child-birth, a Miſcarriage, or been handled by an unskilfull Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife. If there be an Exulceration in the Womb, by which the Veins are eaten thorough, the Blood drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth by little and little, with Pain and Sharpneſſe: the Patient's Body is afflicted with ſharp and cholerick Humours: the Blood, which iſſueth, is at firſt matte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, wheyiſh, blackiſh, or yellow: If it encreaſe, the Ends of the Veins come with the Blood, and the Flux encreaſeth, and is hard to be ſtopped.</p>
               <p>Prognoſticks are; All long and laſting Iſſues of Blood are dangerous, eſpecially thoſe of the Womb; that which comes by ſoaking thorough the Veins, though it continueth longer, yet the Blood and Spirits do not ſo much decay, therefore it is not ſo dangerous. On the contrary, the breaking of the Veins cauſe more danger becauſe of the ſudden iſſuing of Blood, yet is ſooner cured, becauſe the Patient hath Strength and Store of Blood. But of all the other that which
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:115825:160"/> comes from Exulceration is moſt dangerous, becauſe ſome part of the Veins is periſhed, which letteth out the Blood in great abundance, and is very difficult to be cured. If ſhe grow weaker, and the Iſſue more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, there is danger of Death; in elderly Women, it is hard to be cured.</p>
               <p>Since the Cure muſt be performed in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (almoſt) as is praeſcribed in the 51 Chapter <hi>Of the immoderate Flux of the Haemorrhoids,</hi> I ſhall ſay the leſſe. Firſt open a vein in the Arm, and let her bleed much by degrees. Uſe Frictions and Ligatures; and faſten Cupping-Glaſſes to her dugs, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth. Purge with the ſame Medicines preſcribed in the Chapter aforegoing. Alſo Vomits are good, for they draw the Blood upwards, and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Womens Diſeaſes, doth much commend them. Then make uſe of this Powder, much commended by <hi>Johannes Michael Paſchalius,</hi> and it is thus prepared: <hi>Take the Shells of two new layd Eggs burnt; Frankin-cenſe, Maſtick, of each, half an Ounce: Pearls and red Corall prepared, and Amber, of each, two drachms: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matites and Emerald, of each, half a Scruple: Barly meal fine ſifted, two Pugills: the Whites of four Eggs, and chalybiated Water, enough to make the Powder into two Cakes; bake them in an Oven, ſo hard, that they may be beaten to Powder; give, of this Powder, half a Drachm, or a Drachm in the Morning, in Broth made of Sheeps feet or Calves feet.</hi> The Juyce of Plantane, Yarrow, Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, Shepherds Purſe, Knot-graſſe, Comphry, and Horſ-tail, is very good, or a Sirrup made of all or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them is much, and upon good grounds, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. Milk, in which red hot Steel hath been quenched, allayeth the Sharpneſſe of the Humours, and ſtayeth the Flux. Spiknard, in fine Powder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly taken, or applyed to the Womb upon a little
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:115825:160"/> Lint, hath been much approved of. Minerall Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which receive their Tincture from Vitriol, Iron, or Allum, do remove the Cauſe and ſtrengthen the Part. The Chymiſts do much commend the Tincture of Corall, and vitriolated Steel. Before you go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take this neceſſary Caution, that you do not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether give ſtrong aſtringents, but ſometimes Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which ſtrengthen the Liver, and ſomewhat bind. Outwardly foment upon her Loins, Share, and about the Privityes, with a fomentation made of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Herbs. Then anoint the parts aforeſaid with the Oyl of Myrtles, Maſtick, and Quinces: or make an Ointment more aſtringent. adding, Frankincenſe, Dragon's Blood, Sealed Earth, Bolearmenick, and the like. <hi>Unguentum Comitiſſae</hi> is very powerfull in this Diſtemper. Afterwards apply a Plaiſter to the Navel and Loins, Emplaſtrum ad Herniam, Hyſtericum, or Emplaſtrum de Maſtich, either of theſe; or all three are very effectuall. Likewiſe dry Fumes, Peſſaryes, and Injections, for the Womb, may be prepared of the aforenamed Herbs and other aſtringent Simples. When ſhe is cured, you muſt endeavour to prevent the Diſeaſe for the future, by the Rules preſcribed in the 51 Chapter, <hi>Of the Immoderate Flux of the Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids.</hi>

Theſe Humours are bred in the whole Body, or in ſome particular part, or in the Womb it ſelf. They are bred in the whole Body, either by ill Diet, or a vicious habituall Diſtemper.

Theſe Humours may be bred in the Womb, by a cold or hot Diſtemper therein; the cold maketh it unable to digeſt its Nouriſhment, and the hot Diſtemper cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth it, hence cometh this excrementitious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.

               <p>This Diſeaſe is known by the relation of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; from what part it cometh is thus known: If the whole Body ſend this Humour to the Womb, the whole Body appeareth in an evill State, is weary and heavy, as if the Patient were weary with hard labour, and by this Flux her Body is at preſent refreſhed; the Hands and Feet are puffed up, with a great itching and ſtinging, if the Humour be cholerick. If it come from ſome peculiar part, the Symptomes and Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proper to that part appear. If it come onely from the Womb, ſomething hath happened, which hath hurt the Womb, as a Fall or Blow upon the Back or Belly, immoderate carnall Embracements, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the Woman be young, or any Diſeaſe of the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:115825:161"/> Womb. Signes, that diſtinguiſh between this Diſeaſe and an Ulcer in the Womb, or Gonorrhaea, are theſe: If there be an Ulcer in the Womb, that which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is more digeſted, mattery, mixed with Blood and ſtringy, and cometh with pain; and the Woman ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits not of Copulation without pain. In the Gonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaea the Matter comes in a ſmall Quantity, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and is of a ſhining Whiteneſſe. But if it be a Gonorrhaea which is gotten by acting with an unclean Perſon, then is the Womb ulcerated, the Urine ſharp, and many other malignant Symptomes.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is not dangerous, but is hard to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for it is hard to divert the Humours from this Channell, it being the Sink of the Body, through which the ſuperfluous Humours of a healthy Body, are every Month evacuated. That which is blewiſh, green, black, and ſtinking is worſe then that, which is pale, white, and doth not ſtink. This Diſeaſe is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom cured in old Women, becauſe they abound in Phlegm. Laſtly, by its continuance it may breed great evills, as Barrenneſſe, Falling out of the Wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>b, evill habit in the whole Body, and Conſumption.</p>
               <p>To cure, the Humour offended muſt be purged with convenient Medicines; and becauſe Phlegm for the moſt part is the Humour peccant, purge with ſuch Medicines as principally purge Phlegm, with which mix ſuch as purge the Humour mixed. Vomits (if the Patient be ſtrong) are good, becauſe they empty the Stomach of excrementitious Humours, and do powerfully revell the Humours from the Womb. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſufficient Evacuations, let the Patient take ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Decoctions, made of <hi>Lignum Vitae</hi> and <hi>Saſſafras,</hi> if the Patient be phlegmatick; of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Sarſa,</hi> if ſhe be cholerick or melancholy. Alſo Sweat procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſulphurous Baths, is kind. Milk wherein Steel
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:115825:162"/> hath been quenched is very good, and it will be more powerfull it a little Bolearmenick, Sanguis Draconis, and Terra Sigillata, be given with it. Among a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Medicines, which are aſtringont and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for this Diſeale, I ſhall inſert but one or two. <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> doth highly commend this following Electuary: <hi>Take of Gum Arabick and Gum Tragant, of each, two Drachms: Corall of both ſorts, Eg-ſhells burnt, Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, Dill Seeds, Amber, of each, four Scruples: Hony of Roſes, as much as will make into it an Electuary; give half an Ounce in the Morning and faſt two howers after it.</hi> This Julep I have found of great virtue: <hi>Take of the diſtilled Water of Plantane, red Roſes, Oak Leavs, and Knot graſſe, of each, four Ounces; infuſe therein, a whole Night, of the Flowers of Comphry, Bugloſſe, and red Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of each, one Pugill: ſtrain them out, and make it ſharp with Oyl of Vitriol; with the Sirrup of Comphry and red Roſes, make a Julep for four or five Mornings Draughts.</hi> Whatever part ſendeth pblegmatick Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Womb, you muſt ſeek its cure from its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Chapter. To conclude, the Medicines preſcribed in the former Chapter are good againſt this Diſtemper. Outward Remedies, as Fomentations, Unguents, Fumes, Peſſaryes, and Injections, ſuch as are preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the Chapter aforeſaid, are uſefull here.</p>

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:115825:162"/> by the Seed, menſtruall Blood, or other excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Humors, retained beſides the intent of Nature, in the Womb, and there putrified and corrupted, bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth venemous and, malignant Vapours, which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing doth afflict divers parts of the Body. Now theſe Vapours do not alwayes afflict, but when they are ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up by ſome cauſe; (the moſt noted are, ſweet odours, ſweet meats eaten, anger, terror, and grievous paſſions of the mind; theſe and ſuch like bring Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſubject to this Infirmity, into their Fits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their breathing is impaired, ſometimes (to appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) aboliſhed, the Body becomes cold, their Speech gone, and Pulſe intercepted; ſo that they ly for dead, and ſometimes have been laid out for burial, and yet have revived. Sometimes theſe choaking Fits are not ſo extream, yet is accompanied with other hyſtericall Symptomes, as Vomitings, Ravings, Convulſions, Swoonings, and the like. Sometimes the Patient feeleth herſelf, as it were, choaked by an halter or rope, this is cauſed by abundance of Vapours and Winds aſcending from the Womb, (ſometimes ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by hypocondriack Melancholy) which Vapours, compreſſing the Diaphragma and Lungs, hinder Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration, and the Patient feeleth herſelf as it were ſtrangled. Others will have it proceed from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the malignant Vapours, whoſe property is to cauſe Suffocation. Sometimes ſhe loſeth her Breath without pain or ſenſe of Strangling, by reaſon of the ſtupefactive Power of theſe Vapours, which taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the vitall Action from the Heart, and ſo hindreth Reſpiration: For Nature having ordained the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Breath to cool the Heart, and the Heart is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly cooled by theſe venemous Vapours, having no need of the cool Air, Breathing ceaſeth: For the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Spirits being deſtroyed, the Animall, which are
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:115825:163"/> made of them muſt needs loſe their functions; We may alſo ſay that theſe venemous and ſtupiſying Vapours do fly up and aſſault the Brain, and hinder the Influx of the animall Spirits, whereby the Motion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphragma and the Muſcles, which ſerve for Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are hindered. Likewiſe the Womb being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with theſe flatuous Vapours, doth aſcend towards the upper parts, as it were, by a convulſive Motion, which cauſeth a Compreſſion of the Midriff and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Reſpiration. Sometimes theſe ſharp and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Vapours aſcend to the Head, and diſperſe themſelves into the membranous parts, and cauſe divers pains, pricking and ſmarting, and ſometimes ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſwelling; ſometimes they cauſe pains beating like the Pulſe. Sometimes the Falling-Sickneſſe cometh from the Womb, by reaſon of ſharp and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Vapours, which having gotten a powerfull Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, do ſharply ſmite the nervous parts. Theſe Vapours aſſaulting the Heart, the Heart laboureth to expell them, hence ariſeth Palpitation. Likewiſe it cauſeth a great Pulſation in the Back. The Stomach doth oftentimes ſuffer much by this Diſtemper, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Nature of the Humours afflicting, or part of the Stomach it gets poſſeſſion of; as Want of Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, or a depraved Appetite, that is, deſtring Food which Nature diſdains, as Coals, Chalk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Meat, Vomiting, Belching, Hiccough, and pain in the Stomach. If, in the Womb, menſtruall Blood is retained, it floweth back by the Voins into the Liver, from thence ſhed abroad into the whole Body, hence cometh Swelling, Feavers, and other Diſeaſes. If it flows back to the Spleen, Swelling, Stopping, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and hypocondriacal Diſeaſes are bred. Laſtly, Women have pains in their Loins, Thighs, and other parts, which are cauſed by theſe Vapours conveighed
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:115825:163"/> from the Womb. Therefore, to know this from other pains, mark well the Signes of this Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Much may be gathered from what huth already been ſaid, remembring this, you muſt not expect all the Symptomes in one, but ſome in one, and ſome in another, the Breathing faileth, Senſe of Strangling, Coldneſſe of the Body, the Pulſe ceaſeth, and the like, which I have mentioned before. There goeth before the Fit a Noiſe in the Belly below the Navill, Belching, Inclination to Vomit, Wearineſſe, Stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Face pale and wan. As it gathers Strength it bringeth Suffocation or Choaking, afterwards all the vitall &amp; animall Actions are depraved, diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and, as it were, aboliſhed, the Womb may be felt in divers parts of the lower Belly, gathered round like a Ball, toſſing and tumbling to and fro. When the Fit begins to be over, a moiſt Humour floweth out of the Womb, the Body beginneth to be warm, they have a Colour in their Face, they open their Eyes, they ſigh, they begin to move, and ſo by degrees are freed from the Fit.</p>
               <p>Signs of the Cauſes are thus known; If the Seed corrupting in the Womb hath been the Cauſe, there hath preceded thoſe things, which might gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or excreaſe Seed, and cerrupt it in the Womb; as flouriſhing Age, high keeping, and an idle life, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine Complexion and ripe for Generation; or one formerly accuſtomed to the Actions of Generation and left it of: if any ſuch fall into this Diſeaſe, and have their monthly Purgation well, you may judge that Corruption of Seed is the Cauſe. If it come from the Putrefaction of menſtruous Blood, the Menſtrues are ſtopped, or come not down well, and the Woman wanteth no carnall Embracements. If evill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours be the Cauſe, the Woman enjoyeth camall
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:115825:164"/> Excerciſe, and hath her monthly Purgation, but her Body is full of evill Humours.</p>
               <p>Prognoſticks we make thus: This Diſeaſe is ſeldom mortall, but of long continuance; the Patient is in great danger if it continue long, becauſe Reſpiration being ſo often hurt, there is danger that the native Heat be ſuffocated. Young Women when they come to bear Children, for the moſt part they are cured: Old women are ſeldome or never cured. To women with Child it is very dangerous, and threatneth Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: To Women lying in, as dangerous by reaſon of their Weakneſſe. It is good for a Woman to ſneez in the Fits, for it ſignifyeth Strength of the Brain, and it diſperſeth the Vapours from the Brain.</p>
               <p>I ſhall lay down a few Rules, firſt, to give preſent eaſe in the Fit; ſecondly, to give perfect Cure. Firſt, lay her down in ſuch a poſture, that her Neck and Shoulders may ly high, her Thighs and Privities low, ſhooting downwards, that ſo the Womb may be the better reduced. Let her lower parts be rubbed and bound ſo hard as to cauſe pain. And if her Fit be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate, apply Cupping-Glaſſes to her Hips and Share. If ſhe ſwoon, rub the Bottoms of her Feet with Vinegar and Salt, and courſe Cloths. Hollow in her Ears, and bend her Fingers, and if need require apply Epiſpaſtick Cataplaſms to her Feet. Put ſtrong and ſtinking things under her Noſe, as Leather and Fethers burnt, Brimſtone fited, Aſſafaetida, Caſtoreum, and the like. But take this Caution, carefully to diſtinguiſh between this Diſeaſe and the Falling-Sickneſſe, for in the latter ſuch Smells are hurtfull. The Warts that grow upon a Horſes Legs being dryed and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and a Fume made thereof, under the Patient's Noſe, is very good in the time of the Fit. The ſmoak of Tobacco blown into the Mouth and Noſtrils is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115825:164"/> of great efficacy to free the Woman from the Fit-Whilſt you do this, you muſt apply Musk or Civet, wrapped up in cotton Wool, to the Womb. Then blow th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Powder into her Noſe: <hi>Take of white Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Muſtard Seed, Pellitory, and Caſtor, of each, one Scruple: mak it into a very fine Powder, and blow ſome up her Noſe: if you judge it not strong enough, add a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle white Hellebore or Eaphorbium.</hi> Or let her Noſe be anointen with Oyl of Amber. If the Fit be of long continuance give her a laxative, carminative, or wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expelling Cliſter: if one doth it not, give another. Afterwards give another made of Vinegar and Water, and let her drink a little Vinegar and Water. Apply Emplaſtrum Hyſtericum to the Navel, or a Plaiſter made of Galbanum, Caranna, Aſſafaetida, and Tacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahaca. If you find the Sick troubled with plenty of Wind and Vapours, bathe and ſoment the Belly with Fomentations made of emollient, carminative, and diſcuſſing Herbs and Seeds. If the Sick be a married Woman let her have carnall Conjunction with her Husband as ſoon as ever the Fit is over. If that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had, that is, if ſhe be a Maid or Window, let a Mid-wife, tickle the Neck of the Womb with her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger anointed with the Oyl of Muſck, Cloves, or the like, that ſo the offenſive Sperm may be avoided. You may in the Fit give Pills made of Aſſafaetida, Caſtor, Faecula Brioniae, Mirrh, and the like; and, if the Fit be violent, give Pillulae Faetidae. Oyl of Amber given three or four drops in ſome convenient Waters are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good. The After-Birth of a Woman, that lyeth in of her firſt Child, dryed, and powdered, and a Drachm given in ſome convenient Liquor, is excellent: <hi>Quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetanus</hi> his Powder made of Elder-Berryes, taken a Drachm in Wine, is very good.</p>
               <p>For the Cure, you muſt conſider whether the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:115825:165"/> be with Child or not, and be carefull how you adminiſter ſtinking Medicines for fear of Abortion, but rather outward Medicines then inward. Whatever part of the Body ſuffer by this Diſeaſe, either Brain, Heart, Liver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> take care to free and ſtrengthen the part, ſeek the means in their proper Chapters. The Patient muſt once in a Month be purged with ſuch Medicines, as principally regard the Humour offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, adding thereto things that are hyſtericall. If the Body be full of Blood open a Vein, or bleed the Haemorrhoids if Nature requireth it. After generall Evacuation, make uſe of ſweating Decoctions, or let the Patient frequent ſulphurous Baths. Theſe Pills are much commended: <hi>Take of the Troches of Agarick, one Drachm and an half: Hiera of Colloquintida, one Drachm: the Seeds of Carrots, and Agnus Caſtus, of each one Scruple: Mirrh, Caſtoreum, and Diagridium, of each half a Scruple; Venice Turpetine, as much as will ſuffice to make all into a Maſſe, let ber take half a Drachm or two Scruples twice or thrice in a Month.</hi> Or Pillulae Faetidae taken, half a Drachm, once in a Month doth very much cleanſe the Womb. Then make uſe of this Sirrup, much commended by <hi>Mercatus: Take of the Juyce of Mercury, and the cream of Carthamus Seeds, of each, ſix Ounces: the Water of Scorzonera, ſeven Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Sugar, as much as will make it into a Syrrup: while it boiles add of Confectio de Hyacintho, of Alchermes, and Powder of the Electuary de Gemmis, of each, two Drachms; let the Doſe be two or three Ounces.</hi> Aſſaſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida, and Caſtor made into Pills with Hony have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar property againſt theſe Firs: many uſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer with good ſucceſſe, tyed up in a thin ragg or farce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and hung about the Neck: and for this purpoſe the Liver or Fleſh of a Wolf; or the Pizzell, or Stones of a Fox dried and hung about the Neck with a ſtring,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:115825:165"/> reſting upon the Navell; vitriolated Steel, or the Salt thereof, given with Sugar, from two, to twenty grains, according to the Strength of the Patient, is much commended, for opening Obſtructions and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Womb. Eight dayes before ſhe expect her monthly Purgations, let the Woman ſit in a mollify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reſolving Bath, that ſo the Humours may be reſolved and flow forth with her Courſes. Laſtly, Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues made in the Thighs are good, for they derive and turn aſide evill Humours from the Womb.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THis Diſeaſe is a Swelling of the Womb, which is cauſed by Blood mixed with Choller or other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours flowing to the part, vehement Excerciſe, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Copulation; ſome Blow or Fall upon the part: Meats that are ſharp and ſretting, or ſuch things as naturally offend the part, as Cantharides, or Peſſaryes that are of a ſharp Nature, Abortion, hard Labour in Child-bed, or a violent handling by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull Midwife.</p>
               <p>The Signes of this Diſeaſe are, Swelling, Heat, &amp; Pain about the Region of the Womb, the Body fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouriſh. If the Inflammation be in the Neck of the Womb, the pain is felt towards the Groin, if in the former ſide, the Bladder ſuffereth, if in the hinder ſide, the ſtrait Gut will be ſenſible thereof, and the Pain is violently felt about the Loyns. If either ſide of the Womb be inflamed, the Thigh and Groin on
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115825:166"/> the ſame fide will be heavy and pained. If you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conſt tution and preſent Temper of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, you may eaſily gueſſe what Humour offends. If it be purely Blood, the Symptomes are more mild; if Choller be mixed, it is more vehement; if Phlegm or Melancholy, the Diſtemper is more fixed and laſting, but the pain is not ſo vehement. If the Inflammation impoſthumate, and gather Matter, the pain and Feaver encreaſeth, and the Patient hath ſhaking Fits, and moſt of all about the Evening. Sometimes it turns to an Ulcer, which is known by avoiding of ſnotty. Matter or Quittor out of the Womb. If it be party-coloured, green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, or Lead coloured, ſtinking, and cometh away with great pain, it is the worſe. If it depend upon the French Pox or Gonorthaea, their Symptoms will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſame. Sometimes the Inflammation turns not to an Impoſthume nor Ulcer, but to a painleſſe hard Swelling, called a <hi>Schirrus,</hi> which is thus known: the Feaver and pain ceaſeth, and the Swelling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth; there is a hardneſſe, heavineſſe, and Senſe of Weight, bearing down when the Woman ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
               <p>As to the Prognoſtick, I ſhall ſay a word or two of either of them: An Inflammation of the Womb is a dangerous, and de adly Symptome, eſpecially, if the whole Womb be inflamed. If a Woman with Child ſuffer Inflammation of the Womb, the Child dyeth, and probably the Mother followeth. Ravings, Hiccoughs, Coldneſſe of the Hands and Feet, and cold Sweats, are the Meſſengers of Death. If it impoſthumate and turn to an Ulcer, it ought not to be ſlighted, becauſe the Womb is of exquiſite Senſe, and hath a fellow-felling with the principall parts of the Body. If the Ulcer turns cancrous, hollow, or fiſtulous, it is ſeldom or never cured, but vexeth the Patient miſerably all
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115825:166"/> her life-time. An Ulcer in the Neck of the Womb is moſt eaſily cured, becauſe Medicines may be applyed to them immediatly. A <hi>Schirrhus,</hi> or inſenſible hard Swelling, is ſeldom cured, becauſe the naturall Heat is ſo weak in that part, that it can hardly diſcuſſe ſuch an hard and almoſt ſtony Subſtance: If it be not cured it ſoon brings a Dropſy: and if it be tampered with, with over hot and moiſt Medicines, it turns to a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</p>
               <p>The Cure you muſt proſecute thus: Firſt, in the Inflammation of the Womb, give a cooling Cliſter, then open the Baſilick Vein, on the ſame ſide the Womb is inflamed, if all the Womb be inflamed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat your Phlebotomy, afterwards open the lower Veins. Rubbings and Bindings are good, and Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-Glaſſes faſtened to the Loins and Back. Purge the Humour offending with ſuch things as purge gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Then give cooling Juleps or Emulſions to allay the Heat and ſharpneſſe of the Humours; mix there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Narcoticks to give eaſe and reſt, if the Patient be tired out, Apply cooling Liniments and Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms; In Liniments uſe, the Oyl and Ointment of Roſes, <hi>Galen</hi>'s cooling Ointment, Ceratum Santali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, and ſuch like; and with the Oyl of Roſes, white Bread and Milk, make Cataplaſms, adding the Juyce of Henbane, Night-ſhade, Plantant, and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell; or inſtead of the white Bread, the Meal of Barly, Flax and Fenugreek Seed. Of ſuch cool Herbs make Injections, and Peſſaries. But uſe not cooling and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling too long, leſt the Tumor be fixed and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but rather uſe ſoftning and diſcuſſing Medicines with repelling, ſuch as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Marſh and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Mallows, Mugwort, Melilor, Camomill, Fenugreek. If the Patient be ſubject to be coſtive, give gentle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or mollifying and cooling Cliſters. If the pain
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:115825:167"/> be very violent, make Injections with new Milk, and a little Opium: and make Peſſaries of Philonium Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum and a little Cotton and apply it. If it tends to Suppuration, apply a Cataplaſm made of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named ſoftning Herbs, fat Figs, Yolks of Egs, Saffion, Oyl of Lillyes and freſh Butter. When it is broken we muſt endeavour to purge out the Quitter, and cleanſe the Ulcer. You muſt often purge with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Medicines, as Senna, Rubarb, Tamarinds, Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolans, Agarick, Catholicon, and ſuch like, that the evill Humours may be diverted from the Womb; for ſuch who are eaſy to vomit, a gentle Vomit is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. Make a vulnerary Drink to cleanſe and heal the Ulcer: <hi>Take of Agrimony, Burnet, Mugwort, Knot-Graſſe, Plantane, and Yarrow, of each, one Handfull: China Root, half an Ounce: Rha Ponticum, one Ounce: Currance, and French Barly, of each, two Ounces: boil them in Chicken-Broth, and let the Patient take ſomewhat more then a Quarter of a Pint, Morning and Evening.</hi> Venice Turpotine waſhed in Mugwort Water, or in the Water of any other Herb, reſpecting the Ulcer, is good to cleanſe and heal it. If the Humours be ſharp and painfull, inject the Emulſion of the cold Seeds, Goats Milk, or (for want thereof) Cows Milk, with the Juyce of Shepherds Purſe, or of any of the Herbs aforenamed. To dry and fill up the Ulcer, make a Decoction of the aforenamed Herbs, or of the like Nature, made in Water wherein Steel hath been quenched, or in Plantane Water: add thereto Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Hypociſtis, Sanguis Draconis, Bolearmenick, fine Starch, Ariſtolochia rotunda, great Comphry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Unguentum Egyptiacum, de Plumbo, de Ceruſo, and de Apio, are very good in Injections; and the Oyl of the Yolks of Egs, ſtirred in a Leaden Morter, is much more commended. If the Ulcer in the Womb come

               <head>CHAP. LXXVII. <hi>Of the Womb ſwelled by Wind or Water.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>There is a twofold Dropſy of the Womb, one from Wind, which is like that ſort, called <hi>Tympanites,</hi> the other from a watry and wheyiſh Humour, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to <hi>Aſcites.</hi> Some add a third anſwering to <hi>Leuco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegmatia,</hi> which is ſeldom ſeen. This Wind or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is contained in the Cavity of the Womb, or in the Membranes thereof, or in certain Bladders. It is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the weakneſſe of naturall Heat in the Liver or Spleen, from which parts. Wind, Phlegm, or wheyiſh Humours are ſent to the Womb: or by the weakneſſe
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:115825:168"/> of the Womb, thoſe Humours are collected. Cauſes which weaken the naturall heat of the womb are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>viz.</hi> cold aire heedleſly taken into the womb, or ſtaying in the cold, or padling in cold water whilſt the courſes flow: the uſe of cold meates and drinks; add to theſe, abortion, hard labour, immoderat flux of the Termes; all diſeaſes proper to the Womb.</p>
               <p>This diſeaſe is beſt diſcovered by ſignes, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh between this and the univerſall Dropſy of the Belly. The Womb-Dropſy cauſeth a ſwelling, chiefly in the lower Belly; in the other Dropſy, the ſwelling is in all parts: in this the Body decays not, nor there is not ſuch a Thirſt and Drineſſe of the Tongue as in the other; and Wind and Water ſometimes burſteth out at the Mouth of the Womb. Secondly to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the ſorts of theſe Dropſyes, conſider, if Wind be the Cauſe, the lower part of the Belly, being ſtruck, giveth a Sound, thence is a pricking pain in the Belly, which reacheth to the Diaphragma: the Womb riſeth like a Globe towards the ſtomach, Wind burſteth our of its Neck, and the Patient is ſubject to Belching, and when ſhe breaketh Wind, ſhe findeth ſome eaſe. If a watry wheyiſh Humour be the Cauſe, the part appeareth ſoft and flaggy with a Noiſe of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and great Heavineſſe. If from Phlegm, it will be more ſoft; and the parts adjacent, as well as the Womb, have a phlegmatick Swelling. Thirdly, you ought to conſider, whether this Diſeaſe hath its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in the Womb, or by conſent of other parts, thus: if there appear Symptoms of the whole Body or ſome part thereof to be miſaffected, <hi>viz.</hi> if there be long Feavers, or a Flux of Blood, Diſtillations from the Head, Weakneſſe of the Stomach, Swelling of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Spleen, and other ſtubborn Diſeaſes in thoſe arts, judge that the Womb receives its Diſtemper fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:115825:168"/> ſome of theſe parts. On the contrary, if the Body and all the parts are in good health, ſaving ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diſeaſe of the Womb, then judge that the Diſeaſe hath its originall in the Womb. Fourthly, to know, whether the Wind or watry Humour be in the Cavity of the Womb, or in little Bladders, take theſe two Rules, that if it be in the Cavity of the Womb, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a greater Swelling, and more Water flows out at the Neck of the Womb. Secondly, if little Bladders of Water come forth, it is an evident Signe that the Water or Wind is not contained in the Cavity of the Womb. Fifthly, this Womb-Dropſy is eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from Tumors of the Womb, cauſed of blood or Choller, becauſe there is no Feaver; nor pain in the touching of it; it differeth likewiſe from a schirrhous Tumor, for it is not ſo hard as not to yeeld to the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Sixthly, it is very convenient to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Diſeaſe and a Woman's being with Child: when a Woman begins to be big with Child, the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of her Belly buncheth out, in this Diſeaſe it is depreſſed and flat: in the firſt, the Woman's Dugs do ſwell, in the latter they become extenuated and ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. Women with Child, after a while, grow better and better, but in this Diſeaſe they grow worſe and worſe. Again the Child is manifeſtly perceived to ſtir. Laſtly, you muſt diſtinguiſh between this Diſeaſe and the falſe Conception <hi>Mola,</hi> thus: in <hi>Mola</hi> Women find a great heavineſſe in their Wombs, and when they turn toly on either ſide, it roules like a Stone to that ſide: again they that have conceaved with <hi>Mola</hi> (for the moſt part) have a violent Flux of their Terms, every third or fourth Month, and laſtly the Dugs ſwell and ſometimes have Milk in them; which things never happen in this Womb-Dropſy.</p>
               <p>Sometimes this Diſeaſe cometh not to the height
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:115825:169"/> but proveth an Inflation: if it continueth, if the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour be void of Putrefaction, though it continueth long, yet it is curable, nay, ſometimes it floweth out of its own accord. If wind or water be in the cavity it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuated with more eaſe, then if it be ſhut up in Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. If the Humour be malignant and ſharp, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the like Symptoms, and is dangerous, for the moſt part deadly.</p>
               <p>You muſt begin the Cure with Phlebotomy, if the Diſeaſe hath its originall from the Terms, and the Body be plethorick, other wiſe it will much hurt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe natural Heat is much weakned thereby. Then you muſt give ſuch things as have power to purge, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, provoke Sweat, and move the Courſes: you need go no farther then to the 58 and 71 Chapters, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Of the Dropſy and Green-Sickneſſe.</hi> Give a gentle Vomit twice a week, if the Woman be eaſy to vomit. The Heat of the Stomach muſt be cheriſhed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by Medicines preſcribed in the Chapters trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Diſeaſes of that part; and the Womb muſt be ſtrengthned, and the peccant Humours diſcuſſed by Fomentations or Baths, made of the Decoction of the Roots of Briony, wild Cucumber, and horſe Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh: the Leavs of Dwarf-Elder, Mercury, common Elder, Origanum, Calamint, Rue, Sage, Wormwood, Marjarom, Mugwort, Pennyroyall, Time: the Seeds of Annis, Fennel, Broom, Carrots, Cummin, Bay, and Juniper: the Flowers of Camomill, Melilot, and Roſemary. If it be a windy Dropſy, a dry Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be much better. Afterwards anoint with the Oyl of Nard, Rue, Wormwood, Dill, and Southern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Give frequent Cliſters, and Injections to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate the Humours contained in the Womb: then make Peſſaryes, of Coloquintida, Elaterium, Mechoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, and ſuch like, with Hony, and apply it. Nitrous
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:115825:169"/> and ſulphurous Baths do profit much, and, if the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe proceed from Humours falling to the part, let Iſſues be made in the Thighs.</p>

               </head>
               <p>SOmetimes the Womb looſeth its natural Scituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and falleth down to the water-gate, ſometimes out to the very Thigh. All things that may cauſe a Rupture or Relaxation of the Ligaments of the Womb, may be a cauſe of this grief, as a Blow, Fall, dancing, leaping, lifting, carrying, violent ſneezing, or cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (eſpecially in Child-bed, or being big with Child, Tenaſmus, hard Travel, a violent drawing the Child out of the Womb, or of the after-birth, or the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Faculty of the womb, being violently provoked to expel a dead Child, after birth, or the Mole, and many ſuch like Accidents may be the cauſe of the breaking of the Ligaments, and falling out of the Womb. A Relaxation of the Ligaments may be cauſed by a long Defluxion, by Crudityes, the Whites: external Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may be prevalent, as bathing in cold water; the Southern or moiſt Air being received into the Womb, ſoon after a lying in, Meat of a cold and moiſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; to conclude, all Meats, Drinks, and Actions, which will breed Phlegm, or cauſe its Deflux into the Womb.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe needs no Signes to diſcover it by, it being apparent to the Senſe: the cauſes may be thus diſtinguiſhed. If it come by Looſeneſſe of the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it cometh by little and little, the pain is leffe,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:115825:170"/> cauſes, moyſtening the Womb have preceded. If it come by a Rupture, there is a violent pain; ſometimes Blood ſtarteth out, and ſuch cauſes, which have been able tobreak the Ligaments, have preceded.</p>
               <p>If the womb fall down by a rupture of the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is incurable. That which comes by a relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ligaments is not very dangerous, but trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to the patient, it hinders her walking, concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and monthly Purgation. In young Women it is caſlier reſtored to its place, than in elderly. The womb coming not far out, and if taken in time, the Cure is farr more eaſy then if the contrary happen. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times grievous and violent Pains do attend it, and threaten Death. Sometimes the Air corrupteth the womb, and it becomes gangrenated, ſo that there is a Neceſſity that it be cut off.</p>
               <p>You muſt begin the Cure with ſuch Medicines that may diſcharge the Guts and Bladder of their Exere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they may not hinder the Reduction of the womb. Then let her ly upon her Back with her Thighs wide aſunder, and draw up her Knees, and let her with her own hands, or by the help of a Mid wife, thruſt the womb inwards, or (that you may drive it in farther and hurt her leſſe) make a Peſſary of lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen cloaths, and with it thruſt up the womb; firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint it with the Oyl of Lillyes, and, if it be ſwelled, uſe a Fomentation of Althaea, common Mallows, Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek, and the like. Before you repoſe the womb to its place, anoint it with the Muſilage of Comphry Roots, or Infuſion of Gum Traganth, or any thing that is of a glowing Nature. When it is up, let the woman ly with one Thigh over the other, and put up toward the Neck of the womb, a little wool wetted in ted wine or Roſewater, wherein Acatia and Hypocyſtis hath been diſſolved. <hi>Rodericus à Caſtro</hi> adviſeth the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:115825:170"/> Phyſitian to come with a red hot Iron, and to make as if he would thruſt it into the womb: <hi>Avenzoar,</hi> and <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus,</hi> after the uſe of all means and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by this Stratagem reduced the womb, that is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laid her down as before ſaid, and one held down her Thighs and another her Breaſt, then put her into a great fright, by ſetting Mice or Frogs to run up her Legs and Thighs, by this fright the womb hath been reduced into its proper place for by this means. Nature contracteth her ſelf for fear, and draweth the womb with her. Then lay a plaiſter againſt Ruptures, on the Region of the womb and Groins: and have a care that you keep the Body that it be not coſtive nor too ſoluble. To conclude, all the Medicines externall and internall, preſcribed againſt the immoderate flowing of the Menſtrues, are here good: but beware you uſe them not when the Courſes ſhould flow; and, leſt by the frequent uſe of ſuch Medicines, they ſhould be hindered, your Patient being young, &amp; having her Courſes monthly, be ſparing in the uſe of them; but rather let her wear a Truſſe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LXXIX. <hi>Of Barrenneſſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BArrenneſſe or Sterility is an impotency of Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the principall cauſes thereof are four; firſt, when the Woman doth not conveniently receiv the Man's Sperm into her Womb; and this happeneth by divers cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Woman be too young, and the Neck of the Womb too ſtrait for the Man's Yard; the ſame happens to elderly Virgins, being not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:115825:171"/> in actions tending to Generation, their genitall parts become flaggy, withered, &amp; ſo ſtreight that they canot eaſily admit of the Man's Yard; ſome are lame and crooked that they cannot ly in a fit poſture; ſome have a cold Diſtemper in the Womb, that they are dull and have no delight in the act: others are very fat, which cauſeth a Streightneſſe in the paſſage, or their Bellyes, being big, hinder their due conjunction with the Man. Want of love between a Man and his Wife is a great cauſe. Diſeaſes in the Womb or the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent parts, hinder the Reception of the Seed. The ſecond cauſe of Barrenneſſe is when the Woman doth not retain the Seed of the man in her Womb, for ſometimes the Womb is moiſt and ſlippery, and full of excrementitious Humours, by which means the Sperm doth eaſily ſlide back again; and the Orifice of the Womb is ſo looſe &amp; flaggy, that it cannot contract it ſelf to hold the Seed: or it may be ſo ſlack that it cannot contract to do its Office; and this Slackneſſe may be occaſioned by a breaking of the Fibres of the Womb one from another, in hard Labour, or Aborti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: to ſay all, the Whites, or any moiſt Diſtemper of the Womb, may be the cauſe of Barrenneſſe. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, want of ſufficient Nouriſhment of the Womb to cheriſh the Seed may be the cauſe of Barrenneſſe, and this comes to paſſe by any Diſtemper of the Womb that doth corrupt the Seed: a cold Diſtemper extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth, a hot Diſtemper diſſipateth the Spirits in the Seed: a moiſt Diſtemper hindereth the Seeds coming to its due Thickneſſe, and a dry Diſtemper conſumes and drinks up the moiſture of the Seed. Some ſay, Witchcraft and Charms may be the cauſe; certain Meats and Poyſons, many things are antipathetical to Faecundity, as Vinegar, Mints, Water-creſſes, Beans, and ſuch like, Jet, Glow-Worms, Saphires,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:115825:171"/> Smaragds, the Matrice of a Goat of Mule, malignant Diſeaſes may corrupt Seed and hinder Conception, as ſtinking Ulcers, the French Pox, leprous Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the like. The fourth thing that hinders Conception is when the Woman wants fit materialls for the formation of the Embrio, &amp; to augment the ſame; and this chiefly dependeth upon want of ſeed &amp; menſtruous blood; and this defect happeneth to thoſe that are too young or too old, the determined &amp; appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved age is from fourteen to 50. Likewiſe the materials may be ill diſpoſed through evill diet, which cannot breed blood or good ſeed, Diſeaſes weakening nature may cauſe the ſame. Add to all theſe cauſes a diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion or unſureableneſſe between the man's Sperm and the Woman's, that is when the man and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man are of one Complexion, by which means the ſeed of either of them partake of the ſame exceſſe, that is that they are either too hot or too cold; hence it cometh to paſſe that the ſame Woman who could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have a Child by her Husband, after his Death, hath Children by another man, and a man by another Woman. Sometimes a man and Woman live ten years, or more, together and have no Children, and afterwards the woman conceaveth and bringeth forth, and this cometh to paſſe by the change of Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cauſed by years.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now lay down the Signs of all theſe cauſes, but moſt of them are evident to the Senſes; and the reſt, he who cannot diſcover hath not a Head befitting a Phyſitian: therefore, to abbreviate the work, I ſhall leav it to the ſearch of the Ingenious, and trouble the Reader with a few Rules, left by the Ancients, to try whether a Woman be naturally barren or no, <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> adviſeth to wrap the Woman cloſe in Blankets, and burn ſome Perfume under her, and if the Smell
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:115825:172"/> proceed through her Body, to her Mouth or Noſtrills, then certainly ſhe is fruitfull. The ſame Author ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth to put a clove of Garlick peeled into her womb, or Galbanum, and if the Smell come to her Head or Mouth, judg that ſhe is fruitfull. <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> to try whether a Woman be fruitfull or no, giveth a Drachm of Hares Runner, diſſolved in warm water, to the Woman, being in a Bath of hot water, faſting; and if the Woman findeth pains in her Belly, he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her fruitfull, if ſhe hath no pain, he judgeth her barren. Some ſteep Barly in the Urine, and if it ſhoot within ten dayes, they judg the Woman fruitfull. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you try theſe uncertain concluſions upon the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, examine the man, and ſee if the fault be not in him. It is known thus, if the man be unable to raiſe his yard, if he want Sperm, if he hath a ſwelling in his Stones, or if he have the Running of the Reins, he is not fit for Venus School. If the man be of an effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Spirit, if he hath no Beard, if he be long caſting forth his Seed, and taketh little delight in the act, and the Woman in the act feeleth his Seed cold, be ſure the man is unfruitfull; Or Cauſes, which may make the Seed unfruitfull, have preceded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prog:</hi> Theſe that conceave not by reaſon of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of age, have great hopes to live to have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſſe: but if ſhe live above forty and never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved, ſhe hath little reaſon to hope. If Barrenneſs be cauſed by Fatneſſe, or any Diſtemper or Diſeaſe whatſoever, if the Woman can procure Leanneſſe, or have her Diſtemper removed, ſhe may conceave. But if Barrenneſſe be cauſed by evill ſhape of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, it is likely to continue.</p>
               <p>In the cure, you muſt endeavour that whatſoever hindereth may be removed. If tenderneſſe of age be the cauſe, let her wait the time; in the mean while let
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:115825:172"/> her refuſe carnall Embracements, leſt her genitall Members be ſpoiled. If it be cauſed by Age, that is incurable by weakneſſe of Nature, you may endeavour to ſtrengthen the Body and revive the Spirits, but it is difficult. If the Body be too corpulent, or too manly, you muſt extenuate, moiſten, and cool. If any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper of the Womb hinder Conception, labour to remove the Diſtemper. If a hot Diſtemper be the cauſe, cure it as a hot Diſtemper of the Liver. If dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be the cauſe, uſe a reſtorative Diet, ſuch as is preſcribed in the Chapter <hi>Of the Hectick Feaver.</hi> If it be cauſed hy Witch-craft, next to fervent and devout prayers to god, and a confident deſpiſing and ſlighting of Charmes and Witch-crafts, let the Woman wear the Pizzle of a Wolf about her, or the Adamant or Hyacinth Stone, which are much commended againſt Faſcination, likewiſe Sea Onions, Sea Holly, Sagape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Rue, and St John's W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rt, (which ſome call the Divell driver) are of great efficacy. But for the moſt part a cold and moiſt Diſtemper of the Womb and of the Body, being accompanied with the Whites, is the cauſe, whoſe particular cure you may find in its proper Chapter. You muſt purge the cold phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Humours, you muſt make Iſſues in the Arm, Neck, or Thighs, and give ſuch things as ſtrengthen the Womb. Some things there are, which have a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar virtue to cauſe Faecundity and remove Barrenneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the After-Birth of a Woman dried and beaten to powder, and given to the quantity of a Drachm. The Stones of a Bore pig and the Liver, which was farrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alone without any more in that Litter.

               </head>
               <p>ABortion or Miſcarriage is the bringing forth of a Child, either dead or alive, having not attained to the juſt Term of growth, which it ought to have had. The Cauſes are either externall or internall: the externall cauſes do either kill the Child, deprive it of its naturall Nouriſhment, or looſen the bands, by which the Child is faſtened in the Womb. Things that kill the Child are, the Stink of a Candle, or ſuch abominable Smells, ſuch things as are antipatheticall to the Womb, and provoke the Courſes, ſtrong purges, or the Child may be killed by violent Commotions of the Mind, as Anger, Sadneſſe, Terror, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and many times things longed for, and not obtained, kill the Child. If the Mother undergo Penury or Famine, or loſe much Blood, the Child wanteth Nouriſhment. The Bands, by which the Child is faſtened to the Womb, may be looſned by violent Excerciſe, dancing, running, riding, being jumbled in a Cart or Coach, by ſome fall, lifting, or carrying: any thing which cauſeth a violent motion of the Belly, as Coughing, Sneezing, Vomiting, Convulſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Copulation. Internall cauſes of Abortion may be attributed, to the Humours, to the Child, to the Womb. Humours offend in exceſſe or defect; in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, in a plethorick and full conſtitution, when more Blood flows to the Womb, then is requiſite to nouriſh the Child, and flows to the Veins, ſo the Courſes flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provoke the expulſive Faculty, and drive forth the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:115825:174"/> Child. Defect of Humours fit to nouriſh, ſpring from ſuch cauſes, which deſtroy the Nouriſhment or draw it from the Child, as long faſting, loathing, and vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of all Food, immoderate bleeding at the Noſe, Womb, or Haemorhoids, or a Looſeneſſe, or any thing that makes the Body lean or weak.</p>
               <p>The cauſes attributed to the Child are, if the Child be over great, if there be more then one, for the womb overladen, doth exclude the Child before the fit time: likewiſe if the Child be dead, Nature deſires to be rid of it. In reſpect of the Womb, if it be any way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed or defective, that it cannot open as the Child groweth bigger: or if it be moiſt or ſlack, it cannot contain the Child, but Abortion muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>Abortion when it happens is known: there are ſigns preceding it, which do foretell Abortion to follow: her Breaſts grow little and flaggy, ſhe feels a heavineſſe about the Loius and Hips, ſhe hath no appetite to eat, nor deſire to ſtirr, ſhe hath a ſhivering by Fits, ſhe hath Streightneſſe of the Sides and Belly above the Navell, and a pain in her Head: plenty of Milk flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Dugs, ſhews that the Child is weak, and danger of Abortion. If pains about the Reins, Loins, and Share, torment the Woman, then know that Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ortion is hard at hand: the ſame judg, if Blood or Water burſt out and flow; and the Scituation of the Child is changed from the middle of the Belly to the Bottom. If any of theſe or the like Symptoms befall a Woman with Child after any externall cauſe of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ortion, as Blow, Fall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let the Woman betake her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to her Bed and take ſuch Medicines which prevent Abortion.</p>
               <p>Prognoſticks of Abortion are thus made: Women are more endangered by Abortion, then by a naturall,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:115825:174"/> and timely Birth, becauſe in a timely Birth the Veſſels and Ligaments are looſned and opened of their own accord, but in Miſearriage they are broken in ſunder; the like you may perceive between the Stalk of ripe and unripe fruit. Women many times become barren by Miſcartiage, becauſe the womb is rent, and its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur all diſpoſition much altered. Much bleeding, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with Convulſions, raving, and fainting, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes deadly. If an Inflammation of the Womb fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Abortion, it is deadly. In young Women, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bore Child before, it is worſt, becauſe the paſſage is narrower, and they more unaccuſtomed to pains. The bigger the Child is, the more the danger. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who have moiſt and ſlippery Wombs, do often miſcarry and with little danger.</p>
               <p>To prevent Miſcarriage, you muſt, before and after ſhe is with Child, endeavour to remove all evill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the Body or Womb, that may cauſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, if Blood abound open a Vein, purge the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Humours, ſtrengthen the Womb: but if the Woman be with Child, beware how you bleed, except it be in the firſt month, and the Body full of Blood: and in this caſe, let Purges be gentle and often reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. To conclude, to ſtreng then the Womb fetch Medicines from the 73 Chapter.</p>

               <p>HArd Labour is when more vehement Pains and dangerous Symptomes happen to Women in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, and continue a longer time. There are divers
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:115825:175"/> cauſes, ſome whereof may be aſſigned to the weakneſs of the Womans Body, Leanneſſe or Drineſſe as well as Fatneſſe of the Body, her Age, or Sickneſſes, as the Stone or preternaturall Tumor in the Bladder, or any Diſeaſe of the womb. Other cauſes may be aſſigned to the Child, when its Body or Head is too big, when there are two, or when the Child is dead: or when it endeavours to come forth with his Feet, Hands, Back, Belly, or Breech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A cold and dry Air, and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Wind, ſtreightneth the Body, and driveth the Spirits inward, and is obnoxious to the Child's firſt entrance into the world. If the Air be more hot then ordinary, it is as bad as the former, for it diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates the Spirits, exhauſts the Strength, and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth feavouriſh Diſtempers into the Bodyes of Mother and Child. Meats of a hard digeſture or aſtringing quality taken a little before the time of Delivery, Sleepineſſe and Sortiſhneſſe, the Retention of Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all vehement Paſſions of the Mind, want of an expert Midwife, and Women to aſſiſt the labouring Woman, may be cauſes of hard Labour.</p>
               <p>Hard Labour is eaſily known to the Woman herſelf, to the Midwife, and the Aſſiſtants. The time of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Birth ought to be accompliſhed in the ſpace of twenty four houres, if the Woman continue a longer time, it is hard Labour. If her pains be weak and long before they return, and more about her Back then Privityes, the cauſes may eaſily be known; many you may gather from the Relation of the Woman in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, her Leanneſſe, Weakneſſe, Fatneſſe, and Age is perceived. Diſeaſes of the Womb and Bladder may be known by their proper Signes. The Bigneſs, and diſorderly Poſture of the Child, is ſoon ſeen by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Midwife. If the Child be dead, you may know it by theſe Signs, the Breaſts of the Woman become
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:115825:175"/> flat and flaggy, her Eyes hollow and troubled, her Face and Lips are of a pale and leaden colour, her Belly is cold &amp; there is a Senſe of Weight: there is no Motion felt, though you apply ſomthing wetred in the Decoction of Tanſy warm to her Navell. When the Woman turnes, the Child ſways that way like Lead. If the after-Birth come away before the Child, it is a Sign of the Death of the Child. And if the Child cometh not away, it ſoon putrifieth, and ſtinketh, and ſtinking Moiſture floweth from the womb, and their Breath ſtinketh.</p>
               <p>Hard Labour is dangerous, for ſometimes the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſometimes the Child, and ſometimes both do loſe their lives. Sleepy Diſeaſes and Convulſions, if they befall a Woman in Travell, death is at hand. If the Woman be in Travell above three dayes, it is likely the Child will dy. If the Woman fall a ſneez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her Travell it is good, ſaith <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> If the Child be dead, the danger is exceeding great; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if it be not brought ſoon away, for it will cauſe Feavers, Faintings, Convulſions, dead Sleeps, and death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>In difficult Labour, firſt all cauſes, which hinder the Birth, muſt be removed, if it be poſſible; then ſuch things as further the Birth muſt be adminiſtred. An Ounce of Oyl of ſweet Almonds, and a Drachm of Confectio Alchermes given in Broth is good. Burn white Wine with a little Saffron and Cinnamon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards diſſolve a little Alchermes, this I have found very powerfull to haſten the Birth. If you find this Medicine too gentle, make a Julep of more efficacy, thus: <hi>Take of the Water of Mugwort, and Vervain, of each, two Ounces: the Sirrup of Maiden-hair, one Ounce: Confectio Alchermes, half a Drachm: Dittany of Creet, and both Birth worts, of each, one Scruple: Oyl
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:115825:176"/> of Cinnamon, five Drops, mix them, and make a Potion:</hi> Oyl of Amber, fifteen Drops; or the Extract of Saffron, five Grains; may be either of them mixed inſteed of the Oyl of Cinnamon. Provoke ſneezing, and open the lower Veins if need be. Then let the Midwife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint the Mouth of the womb, with the Oyl of Lillyes and Sweet Almonds, and the like: and foment the Belly with a mollifying Decoction: and in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous caſe give a ſharp Cliſter. Some things have a peculiar property to help the Birth, as the Stone Aeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, Loadſtone, and Storax held neer the Privityes; the Eyes of a Hare taken out in the month of March and dryed, uſe it as the Stones, and when the Woman is delivered take them away, leſt it draw out the Womb. Some commend the Gall of an Hen, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Navell.</p>
               <p>If the Child be dead, give the ſame things before mentioned, but it is convenient to make them ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by adding Savin Water and the Leavs of Savin dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Troches of Mirrh and Caſtor. Then foment the Privityes and Share with a mollifying Decoction, to which add Briony Roots, and the Roots of wild Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber, round Birth-wort, and the like. And put up a Peſſary made in this manner: <hi>Take of the Roots of round Birth-wort, Orice, black Hellebore; Coloquinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da and Mirrh, of each, one Drachm: Galbanum, Opopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax, of each, half a Drachm, with Ox Gall, make a Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and apply it.</hi> If all this will not do, you muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the help of the Chirurgion.</p>
               <p>If the After-birth be retained, you muſt endeavour to expell it by ſuch Medicines as expell the dead Child: to which add theſe which are ſaid to have a ſpecifick property, the Stones of a gelded Horſe, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and powdered, and given as much as will ly on a three pence, two or three times as need requireth, is
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:115825:176"/> commended by <hi>Geſnerus</hi> and <hi>Augenius.</hi> Some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Juyce of an Onion given in Wine, or an Onion held in the Woman's mouth, between her teeth, and the Juyce ſqueezed out and ſwallowed, and a Draught of white-Wine drunk after it: Or 20 or 30 drops of the Oyl of Juniper drunk in Wine; or the Juyce of Lovage taken in Reniſh Wine.</p>
               <p>If her Purgations flow immoderately, that you fear the Death of the Woman; or in caſe her Purgations be ſuppreſſed, which may cauſe dangerous Symptoms, have Recourſe to the Chapters treating of thoſe Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes.</p>
               <p>Many Women are much troubled with after-pains, which do much afflict them, and theſe pains, are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed either by the Thickneſſe, or Sharpneſſe of the Blood; or by Wind. If the Blood be thick, you may know it by its clotting: if thin, by its Tenuity or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Colour. If the Blood be thick, give this Julep: <hi>Mugwort water, two Ounces: ſirrup of Violets, &amp; oyl of ſweet Almonds, of each, half an Ounce:</hi> If the Blood be ſharp, add to the former, the Muſilage of Quince Seeds drawn with Violet Water, half an Ounce: If Wind be the Cauſe of theſe Pains, which you may know by its Motion from one part of the Belly to the other, then give inwardly and apply outwardly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative Medicines; <hi>Take of the Seeds of Carrots, one Drachm: of Anniſe, Nutmeg, and Cinnamon, of each, a Scruple, make them into fine Powder, and give it half at one time in Wine.</hi> Foment her Belly with the Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Bawm, Bay Leavs, Camomill, Calamint, Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort; and the Seeds of Carrots, Caraway, and Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, and lay on a Pultiſe made of boiled Onions, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momill Flowers, the Seeds of Flax and Cummin bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and Barly Meal.</p>

The immediate cauſe of the Gout is a wheyiſh Humour flowing to the Joynts, and by its Quantity ſtretcheth the ſenſible parts, or by its Sharpneſſe twitcheth them, and this Humour floweth not onely from the Brain and Head, but from all parts of the Body. The cauſe may be attributed to all Meats, which encreaſe raw and whey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Humours; Meats of a groſſe Subſtance hard to be digeſted, and ſuch as afford plenty of Excrements; Gluttony, Drunkenneſſe, immoderate Venery, (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gout is called the daughter of <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi>) long Sleep, and unſeaſonable Watchings, Fear, Sadneſſe, continuall care, and intermiſſion of ſuch Excerciſes or Evacuations as men have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to, and the like.</p>
               <p>The beginning of the Gout is known thus, there is a more exquiſite and quick Senſe in the Joynts then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: they are eaſily hurt, as by a new ſhooe, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:115825:177"/> the leaſt touch againſt any hard thing. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a Feaver uſhers it in: and at its approach there is a kind of unuſuall Heat felt in the Joynts, and a Motion, as if ſome living Creature were therein: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, followeth a tormenting pain in the Joynts, for the moſt part beginning in the great Toe, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Redneſſe and Swelling.</p>
               <p>The Signes of the cauſes, or the Humours, which are mixed with the wheyiſh Humours, are thus conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. If choller be mixed with the wheyiſh Humour, the Urine is thin, yellowiſh or red, the pain great and violent, the Feaver comes to the height, the part is ſwelled, is red or pale, but very hot, the application of cold things giveth eaſe. If Phlegm be mixed, there is a ſoft and looſe ſwelling of the part, the pain not ſo violent; the Urine is thick and troubled, little or no Heat, and hot things give eaſe. If Melancholy be the Humour mixed, the Temper of the Body inclineth to Melancholy, and there is a wearineſſe felt all over, the part is of an obſcure Colour like Lead, the pain deep, and the Urine thick and melancholy.</p>
               <p>The Gout is no dangerous Diſeaſe, but it continueth long, and is attended with violent pain, for the moſt Part to the end of a man's life, and ſometimes it is a means of long life; becauſe Nature doth drive the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Humours to the Joynts, which, if they ſhould fall upon the more noble parts, would be a means of great Diſeaſes, if not death it ſelf. But in weak Bodyes, that are decayed by Sickneſſe or Age, that Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expell theſe Humours to the Joynts, many dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Diſeaſes are ingendered. He that hath no knots in his Joynts, is inclinable to Labour, and is for the moſt part ſoluble; by a skillfull Phyſitian, may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. An haereditary Gout is ſeldom or never cured. If the Veins of a gouty Perſon do ſwell with black
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:115825:178"/> Blood, there is hopes that the Gout leavs him. If the Gout doth not return at its ſeaſon it is dangerous, unleſſe the matter be taken away by Medicines, for it is an argument that Nature is weak, and cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it.</p>
               <p>The Cure of the Gout is to be performed by ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Flux of the Humours into the Joynts: by removing the Humours in the Joynts: and to abate the Sharpneſſe of the pain. If the Patient be full of Blood and ſtrong, let him bleed in a great Quantity, or let him blood often, till the plenitude of Blood be ſufficiently abated. Then let him be purged with ſtrong Medicaments, which may evacuate the ſtirred Humour, and turn the cauſe from the Joynts. Whilſt you are purging, let Ointments or Plaiſters, be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Joynt above the part affected, of an aſtringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drying property; by which the Humours may be intercepted, that they may not ſo much nor ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly fall into the Joynt, Let your Ointments be made of the Roots of Snake-weed and Tormentill, Bolearmenick, Sanguis Draconis, Pomgranate Rinds, Balauſtians, red Roſes, the Whites of Egs, Vinegar, Oyl of Roſes, of unripe Olives, and the like. If the Patient be ſtrong and eaſy to vomit, give a gentle Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to carry away the Humours in and about the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; ſoon after vomiting purge ſtrongly. Sweating Medicines are very good to diſcuſſe the wheyiſh Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; if a Feaver be preſent, give Harts-horn with Carduus water. In a Gout without a Feaver, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Saſſafras, Salſa, and China, may be given; it is not amiſſe if the Heat thereof be allayed, by boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with it Endive, Succory, Sorrell, Burrage, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloſſe, and the like. The Waters of <hi>Bath</hi> do provoke Sweat, and do readily and profitably diſcuſſe the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in the Joynts. <hi>Forreſtus</hi> commendeth
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:115825:178"/> the Decoction of the Root of the great Burdock, for this purpoſe. Likewiſe a Decoction of Elder, Bay Leavs, Sage, Roſemary, and ſuch like, receiving the Vapour in a ſweating Tub. Afterwards come to lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Medicines: <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> doth commend the Milk of a Goat, milked warm upon the part affected, or you may make a Cataplaſm with it and white bread, and the Muſilage of the Roots of Marſh-Mallows, the Leavs of Henbane, Violets, and the like, and if the pulp of Caſſia, and Venice-Treacle be added, it will be much more effectuall. The diſtilled Water of Frogs Spawn is very good againſt the pains of the hot Gout, if the part be bathed therewith; with it you may mingle the Oyl of Calves Feet, or with the Flowers of Camomill, Melilot, Roſes, Mullein, Mallows beaten, you may bring it into the form of a Poultis. Green To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco leavs are much commended, and ſo is a living Whelp laid to the gouty part. When the Pain ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth violently, uſe Narcoticks: as Plantane, Lettice, Henbane, Houſleek, Night-ſhade, Mandrakes, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlane, and Poppy Heads; but be ſure you let them not ly on too long, for they are inimicall to the naturall Heat, and to the Nervs. Some do commend this Fomentation: <hi>Take Spirit of Wine, well tinctured with Saffron, four Ounces: Camphire, one Scruple: boil them a little, and diſſolve one Drachm of Opium; and bathe the pained part.</hi> The Oyl of Wax is good to eaſe the Gout, and the Oyl of Mans Bones is preferred before all other, and it is thus made: <hi>Take the Bones of a man freſh and unburied, break them ſmall, and let them ly in Oyl till they have drunk up as much as they can, then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till them in a Retort.</hi> The Root of Briony and Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kow-pintle, bruiſed &amp; mingled with Cow dung, is an excellent Cataplaſm. I might here fill a Volume with Receipts againſt the Gouts; but paſſing by all, I
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:115825:179"/> ſhall onely inſert one or two out of <hi>Quercetanus</hi> his Diſpenſatory: <hi>Take Brine, Salt, and the Urine of a Boy; of each, equall parts: diſtill them, and dip linnen Cloaths in the Water, and apply them to the place affected, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them often. Take green Elder Leavs and Flowers, of each, one pound: beat them in a Morter, and macerate them in Aqua-Vitae, three dayes, then distill them till all be dry, uſe it as before. Take of rectifyed Spirit of Wine, two pound; of the best Hony, one pound: diſtill them in Balneo Roris, from which will come two Liquors, the firſt wateriſh; the ſecond ſtrong and ſulphurous: keep them by themſelvs. To the Foeces add of orientall Saffron whole, one Ounce and an half; Venice Turpetine, two Ounces: Caſtor, ſix Drachms: Tartar calcined white, half a pound: Salt diſſolved, one Ounce; Phlegm of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol not ſeperated from the Spirit, four Ounces: Lye made of the Aſhes of Vine Branches, two pound: mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them twenty four hours, then diſtill them till all be dry, keep this alſo by it ſelf.

               <p>To prevent its return, let the Patient bleed twice in a year, <hi>viz.</hi> at Spring and Fall; and purge 4 times in a year, and make uſe of ſweating Drinks, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſulphurous and nitrous Baths.</p>
               <p>The Sciatica differeth nor from the other Gout one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in its Scituation, which is in the Hip, extending the pain to the top of the Buttock, the Loins, and Osſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crunt, and reacheth down the Hip and Leg even to the Foot.</p>
               <p>This peculiar Prediction belongeth to this Diſeaſe, that if it continueth long, it putteth the Hip out of Joynt.</p>
               <p>The Cure is performed allmoſt in the ſame manner with the other Gout. Firſt open the Vein in the Arm on the ſame ſide, afterwards open the lower Veins on the ſame ſide, <hi>viz. Vena Poplitea</hi> about the knee, or the Vein neer the outward Ancle called the Sciatica
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:115825:180"/> Vein, if you open the Vein on the contrary ſide, it will not do amiſſe; bleeding the Haemorrhoid Veins by Leeches doth wonderfully help thoſe that are Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouty, for there is a great conſent between thoſe Veins. But be not too forward to let Blood unleſſe you find Blood to abound. Then let the Humours be purged ſtrongly, by Pillulae Faetidae, or Hermodactylls, or the Powder of Hermodactylls compound, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware how you give the latter except to ſtrong Bodyes. <hi>Mercurius Dulois</hi> with Scammony is much commended, and the Chymiſts do much eſteem of Mercuriall and antimoniall Purges; and many preferr Vomits before all. Then apply reſolving Decoctions made of the Roots of Briony, Danewort, the Leavs of Ground-Pine, Mint, Marjarom, Sage, Savin, Rue, Roſemary, Pennyroyall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Flowers of Camomill, Melilor, and Mallows; the Seeds of Flax, Fenugreek, Bay &amp; Juniper Berryes, and ſuch like, and foment the part therewith. Alſo Juniper Berryes fryed in a pan, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt beaten,) with Salt and Bran, and moiſtned with Canary Wine, and put in a Bag, and applyed warm. With the aforenamed Ingredients, Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms may be made; and with the Oyls following let the part be anointed, <hi>viz.</hi> Oyl of Camomill, Dill, Nord, Orice, Rue, Scorpions, Tiles, Turpentine, of Foxes, and the like: the Ointment of Marſh-Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and Spaniſh Soap diſſolved in Spirit of Wine. This is much commended: <hi>Take a good Quantity of Snails, bruiſe them well in a Morter, then make Paſte with them and Rye Flower, adding a little Spirit of Wine: and faſten it to a Spit and roaſt it; a Liquor will drop from it, with which anoint the part, for it is of excellent Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> Then lay on this Plaiſter: <hi>Take of Shio-Pitch &amp; Rozin, of each, two Ounces: Gum Ammoniacum diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in Vinegar, and Emplaſtrmm Diachylon cum Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:115825:180"/> of each, one Ounce: Brimſtone and Hermodactylls powdered, of each, three Drachms: Turpentine, three Drachms, and Wax ſufficient; make a Plaiſter.</hi> If the Diſeaſe do ſtill continue, proceed to a Veſicatory: add to the former Maſs for a Plaiſter, Cantharides their Wings taken off, Staveſ-acre, and Muſtard Seed, of each, one Drachm. In the whole courſe of the Cure let not frequent Cliſters be neglected. And if the Diſeaſe be old, make an Iſſue in the Leg on the ſame ſide, on the outſide of the Leg. If you find Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a Catarrh; which may occaſion the Sciatica by a Defluxion of Humours, make an Iſſue in the hinder part of the Head, and uſe other means to correct the Diſtempers of the Brain, <hi>See Chap.</hi> 9. by this means hath the Sciatica been cured, when all other means failed. Sometimes the Matter cauſing the Sciatica, doth impoſthumate; and after it is opened, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a filthy Ulcer, which, for the moſt part, pineth the Patient away, &amp; brings him into a Conſumption; The Cure whereof belongeth to an expert Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

It is cauſed by ſome internal cauſe, as ſome hot fiery Swelling on ſome part of the Body, or when ſome hot Excrements, ſhut up in ſome part, do offend the Heart, by Retention of Excrements
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:115825:181"/> and Obſtruction of the Veſſels, by which the Pores of the Skin are ſhut, and Tranſpiration is hindered. Or ſecondly it is cauſed by externall cauſes, as vehement Motions of the Body or Mind, by which the Spirits are inflamed, by being heated with the Sun, or Fire, by Surfetting, Drunkenneſſe, eſpecially, with Meats and Drinks of a hot Nature.</p>
               <p>By what hath gone before, you may know this Feaver: the Pulſe is ſwift and great, and ſo he fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Breath; he is very hot, and his Head aketh. He hath no Shivering, Cold, nor Wearineſſe, unleſſe it came by the Heat of the Sun, or by cold. You muſt give the Sick ſuch things as are cooling &amp; moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as cooling Broths, Barly Cream, Ptiſan Drink, ſmall Beer and Sugar, Water and Sugar, or mix Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Violets, Lemmons, or Maiden-hair, with his Drink. If the Diſeaſe was cauſed by the Heat of the Sun, give him cooling things, and lay him in a coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Lodging, and anoint his Temples with Vinegar of Roſes. If he took his Feaver, being in the cold, provoke Sweat; the like obſerve if the Pores be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. If it come by over eating and drinking, let him take a Cliſter; If evill Humours abound in the Blood and Body, open a Vein and purge; if putrified Humours lodge in the Stomach, vomit. If it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue above three dayes, it degenerates into a ſimple Synochus, putrid, or Hectick Feaver.</p>

               <p>IF the Feaver aforeſaid light upon a plethorick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or one who is groſſe and thick skinned, it turns to a ſimple Synochus.</p>
               <p>It is known by the corpulent and ſwelling Habit of the Body, high Colour of the Face. He breathes with difficulty, he is much pained in his Head, and his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples beat ſtrongly. The Pulſe is orderly, but quick and full. The Urine little differeth from its naturall colour, yet a little thick and red: and the Heat is not very violent. It laſteth to the fourth, and ſometimes to the ſeuenth day; if it ends not then, it degenerates into a putrid Feaver.</p>
               <p>The Cure is to be performed by blood-letting, by cooling, and by opening the Pores of the Body. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore blood-letting, if the Patient be coſtive, and his Body foul, give an emollient and laxative Cliſter. Then give cooling Juleps, made of the Decoction of Barly and cool Herbs, or with their diſtilled Waters, as of Endive, Succory, Sorrell, Bugloſſe, Borrage, and the like, with the Sirrups of Succory, Lemmons, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, Violets, Pomgranates, and the like, adding ſome drops of Oyl of Vitriol; or boil in the diſtilled Waters Triaſantalon, or Diamargariton frigidum, leſt the Waters encreaſe Crudityes by their Rawneſs. Or you may make an Emulſion of Almonds, the great cold Seeds, and white Poppy Seeds, with Barly water, or the diſtilled Water of the aforegoing cooling Herbs. <hi>Galen</hi> adviſeth, to give the Patient cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:115825:182"/> in great abundance, till his colour fade, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware this Cure unleſſe the Patient be ſtrong, corpulent, and not full of ill Humours, and that he take it in the height of the Fit. I confeſſe I have ſeen many ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and have experimented it upon my own Body, but durſt not adviſe it. Anoint the Liver and Loyns with <hi>Unguentum Roſatum, Refrigerans Galeni, or Cera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Santalinum.</hi> Or make an Epithem of the diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Waters of Endive, Succory, Sorrell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the three Sanders, and Powder of Diamargariton frigidum. If the Diſeaſe end not quickly after bleeding, purge with gentle things, that do not heat, nor much ſtirr the Humours, as Rubarb, Caſſia, Manna, Tamarinds, Sirrup of Roſes, Catholicon, and ſuch like.</p>

               <p>I Shall deſcribe the cauſes and Cures of all putrid Feavers in one Chapter, for though there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts, yet the Cure is almoſt the ſame in all; therefore, laying aſide particular precepts, let the Judgment and Dexterity of every Phyſitian put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them. I ſhall likewiſe wave many nice deſcriptions and definitions of Feavers, firſt, as not beneficiall to the young Student in Phyſick: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as not befitting this Volume.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Synochus putrida</hi> is engendred of the ſame cauſes as the ſimple Synochus, as the ſhutting up of the Pores of the skin, and Obſtruction of the Veſſels by much Blood, or clammy Humours; by which means, the Transſpiration of fuliginous Vapours is hindered, and Putrefaction is bred in the Blood.</p>
               <pb n="367" facs="tcp:115825:182"/>
               <p>A continuall Tertian doth every third day afflict the Patient more then ordinary, and is cauſed by cholerick Humours putrifying in the <hi>Vena Cava.</hi> And it is cauſed by all things that may breed Choller, as violent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, hot and dry Air, Faſting, Watching, Meats hot and dry, and a hot and dry Diſtemper of the Liver.</p>
               <p>A Quoridian continuing, is a putrifying of phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Humours in the Veins; and afflicts the Patient more then ordinary every day, and doth for the moſt part aſſail phlegmatick perſons; and becauſe Phlegm is not eaſily putrifyed, this kind of Feaver is ſeldom ſeen.</p>
               <p>The continuall Quartane is that which hath its Exacerbations or Fits every fourth day, and it is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Putrefaction of Melancholy in the <hi>Vena ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> and is cauſed of any thing that breeds Melancholy and cauſeth it to putrify.</p>
               <p>Of theſe Feavers there are accidentall differences, raiſed from their diſtinct Symptomes. Firſt, <hi>Febris ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> or a burning Feaver, which is accompanied with theſe Symptomes, <hi>viz.</hi> an ardent burning Heat, and an unquenchable Thirſt; which is alſo divided into two ſorts, a Legitimate, or baſtard burning Feaver, a <hi>Synochus ardens</hi> and <hi>Ardens periodica,</hi> and they differ one from the other, only as the Choller cauſing them is more or leſſe ſharp, and neerer or farther from the heart. A Second ſort is <hi>Febris Colliquans,</hi> a melting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which in regard of the greatneſs of the Heat, doth melt the fat, and Fleſh, and ſometimes the Blood, and diſſolveth it by inſenſible Transpiration, Sweat, Urine, or Stool. It is cauſed by a ſharp, thin, and cholerick Matter, vehemently inflamed, unto which is joyned many times a malignant and peſtilent Quality. The third ſort is called <hi>Febris Horrifica,</hi> in which the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is troubled with ſhaking Firs; and it is cauſed by
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:115825:183"/> chollerick and phlegmatick Humours mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which being unequally moved, ſtirreth up qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; either becauſe the thin and ſharp Humours do twitch the ſenſible membranous parts, or the inflamed Choller putrifying, puts in Motion the Crudityes; or elſe Nature doth ſeek to ſhake off the crude undigeſted Humours, by this means th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Heat being driven back to the Center, the extream parts of the Body become cold; and afterwards, the Heat comming forth again, they grow hot. Fourthly, there is another kind cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Aſſades Febris,</hi> in which the Patient is very unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, tumbleth and toſſeth, and is ſick in his Stomach, and vomiteth. The fifth ſort is call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d <hi>Elodes,</hi> in which the Patient, by reaſon of Putrefaction &amp; Malignity of Humours, continually ſweateth, by which the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Body is waſted. The ſixth ſort is <hi>Febris Syncopalis,</hi> becauſe the Patient often ſwoons &amp; faints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way &amp; it is cauſed by thin, ſharp, &amp; venemous Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or by Phlegm, or abundance of Crudityes, together with a weakneſs of the Stomach. The laſt ſort is <hi>Epiala Febris,</hi> in which the Patient is ſenſible of Heat &amp; Cold at one and the ſame time; and this is cauſed by glaſſy Phlegm mingled with bitter Choller, the Phlegm cauſeth a Senſe of Cold, and the Choller of Heat: or elſe it is cauſed by glaſſy Phlegm alone, partly putrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and partly void of Putrefaction. For glaſſy and tough Phlegm doth not quickly putrify, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and that which is not putrified following that which is putrified, hence comes a Senſe of Cold from the firſt, and Heat from the latter.</p>
               <p>There are yet other ſorts of accidentall differences of continuall Feavers, which are called Symptomatick Feavers, which ariſe from the Inflammation and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction of the Humours in ſome of the Bowels, and of this kind are thoſe Feavers, which accompany the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:115825:183"/> Frenzy, the Pluriſy, Squinzy, the Inflammation of the Lungs or Liver, and other Inflammations, Ulcers, or Impoſthumes of the internall parts, and may be known by the defects of the parts, which cauſe them. Yet take this Caution, that all theſe Feavers which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company theſe Diſeaſes are not Symptomaticall, but ſometimes eſſentiall, and precede the Diſeaſe, as is commonly ſeen, that one may be ſick three or four dayes of a continuall Feaver, before any pain in the ſide or Symptome of the Pleuriſy appear, the ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> you may find preceding the other Diſeaſes, and is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation worth note, and of great Moment in the practiſe of Phyſick.</p>
               <p>There are other peculiar and extraordinary Cauſes, which many times happen, of which <hi>Zechius</hi> propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth an extraordinary example, of a certain Infant, ſcarce two years old, who had a continuall Feaver, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with grievous Symptomes, <hi>viz.</hi> Unquietneſſe, Convulſions, and Vomitings; the externall parts were cold, and the internall parts burned with Heat, for which cauſe they judged that ſome Malignity was joyned to the Feaver, which is ſeldom accompanied with ſuch Symptomes: at length the cauſe was found to ariſe from Blood putrifying in the Stomach; for the Infant being Tongue-tied, and a little before cut by a Chirurgeon, the Veins, beingcut, ſhed Blood, which, for want of care, fell into the Stomach; after the taking of Oyl of ſweet Almonds, it vomited clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Blood, then by the help of a Cliſter, it voided more downwards, and the Feaver and its Symptomes ceaſed.</p>
               <p>Theſe Feavers are known to be continuall by their Continuity, and the Putrefaction is known by a more ſharp and biting Heat then ordinary; the Pulſe is great, quick, and unequall, the <hi>Syſtole</hi> is quicker then
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:115825:184"/> the <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> becauſe Nature doth more ſtrive to expel the ſooty Vapours, then to draw in cold Air. The Fit beginneth with a cold Shaking, or ſome of theſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, <hi>viz.</hi> Wearineſſe, Watching, troubled Sleeps, difficult Breathing, Pain of the Head and Stomach, Plenty of Excrements, Yawning, and Retching: when it comes to the height, theſe Symptoms are heightned, and ſeconded with Giddineſſe, Ravings, Hiccoughs, Heart-burning, Thirſt, and Blackneſſe and Roughneſs of the Tongue. Particular Signs demonſtrate peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar differences. The <hi>Synochus putrida</hi> hath the ſame Signs, which are proper to <hi>Synochus ſimplex,</hi> but more vehement. Signs of a Feaver from Choller, are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Pain, the Pulſe ſwift and quick, a fiery and crude Urine, without Sediment at the beginning, chollerick Vomits and Stools, Thirſt, and Bitterneſſe of the Mouth, Drineſſe and Blackneſſe of the Tongue, Want of Sleep, Raving, and the like. A <hi>Synochus putrida</hi> differs from a <hi>Synochus bilioſa</hi> in this, that the firſt hath Fits every third day, the other keeps the ſame Tenor.</p>
               <p>A continuall Quotidian is known by theſe Signes, the Heat at firſt is more mild, afterwards more ſharp: the Pulſe is not ſo quick nor great as in the former; the Urine is at firſt white and troubled, afterwards red and thick; little Thirſt, no Sweat unleſſe ſalt Phlegm abound, the Face is ſwelled, bloat, and of a Lead Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and all Signs of Phlegm appear.</p>
               <p>A continuall Quartane is known by this, that the Symptomes are not ſo violent as in the chollerick Feaver, and ſharper then in the phlegmatick or Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian. An appearance of cold, dry, melancholy-Symptomes, and the Fits invade the Patient more then ordinary every fourth day.</p>
               <p>The burning Feaver is known by the Signes of a Feaver proceeding from Choller.</p>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:115825:184"/>
               <p>A melting Feaver is known by a fat and oyly Urine chollerick, fat, clammy, and ſtinking Stools, the Noſe ſharp, and a ſudden Conſumption of the whole Body.</p>
               <p>I need not tell you how, ſhivering, or tumbling and toſſing Feavers are known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elodes</hi> is known by inordinate Sweats, abundance of Urine, and thick by reaſon of Putrefaction; the Stools ſhew an apparent Waſting, and the loſſe of Strength doth manifeſt the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Syncopalis Febris</hi> is known by the ſwooning Fits: <hi>Epiala,</hi> by Heat and Cold felt together: and Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatick Feavers, from the Diſeaſes from which they proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Signa Prognoſtica: Synochus putrida</hi> is not without danger. If Signes of Concoction appear about the fourth day, the Diſeaſe will terminate about the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day. If Concoction appear not, and the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's Face is ſwelled, it will continue long. The red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Urine is, the better, if Concoction appear; but with Signes of Crudity it threatens death. White Urine is worſt and threatens death. Chollerick Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are acute and dangerous, and ſo much the more, as the Symptomes are violent, and encreaſed above the naturall Temper of the Patient. A continuall Quotidian continueth long for the moſt part, becauſe of the thickneſs of the Humours, the more Evacuations the better; beware leſt it degenerate into a Chachexy or Dropſy. A continual Quartane is rare: ſometimes the quartane Ague degenerates thereunto, &amp; is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the moſt part. The melting, ſweating, ſhaking, tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling, ſwooning Feavers, are dangerous. Sympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Feavers are to be judged from the excellency of the part affected, the Nature of the Diſtemper, and the Validi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:115825:185"/>
               <p>Medicines in a cholerick Feaver ought to be cooling and moiſtning; in phlegmatick and melancholy, more warm and attenuate. Let the Air be cold and moiſt, let cool Water be ſprinkled upon the ground, with Herbs and Flowers, let the covering of his Bed be light and thin. Let his diet (if he eat any thing) be very ſharp, thin, and ſlender. Let his drink be Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Water, and his Meat Barly Broths, Pavados, and ſuch like. If the Feaver be of long continuance, let the Sick make uſe of a fuller Diet, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Broth or Fleſh of Chickens, Hens, Capons, Partridges, Veal, Mutton, or Gellyes made with them. In his drink or Barly Water let cool Herbs be boiled, and give it a gratefull Relliſh with Spirit of Vitriol. If the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ariſe from not and thin Choller, or if there be a Conſumption of the Lungs, Inflammation of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, bloody Flux, Ulcers of Kidneys and Bladder, or Piſſing of Blood; ſharp things are not good, but rather ſuch things as gently thicken, as Barly Water, with Sirrup of Violets, or of dryed Roſes. Sleep is very good and Watching hurtfull, yet overmuch Sleep doth overwhelm the naturall Heat, and hinder Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation: which ought to be made, and nothing to be retained, which ought naturally to be expelled. Firſt, Blood-letting doth diminiſh Plenitude of the Body and Veins, pulls back the Humours which cauſe Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cooles the Body, and makes it perſpicable, keeps back Putrefaction, and furthers Concoction. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after the Patient hath had a Stool by Cliſter or otherwiſe, open a Vein, and bleed the Patient accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Strength and preſent State. But this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that you bleed not in the extremity of the Fit. When Weakneſſe or Age will not permit a Vein to be opened, Copping-Glaſſes muſt be applyed. Frictions muſt not be uſed but in ſwooning Feavers. After you
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:115825:185"/> have let Blood, once, twice, or thrice, if you ſee occa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion, come to purge the morbifick Matter; the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines for this intent muſt be Caſſia, Manna, Tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinds, Catholicum, Electuarium lenitivum, Diaprunum ſimplex, Sirrup of Roſes, and of Succory with Rubarb. Some do object againſt Rubarb for its Heat, Manna and Sirrup of Roſes becauſe it is ſweet and ſoon turned into Choller; but being mingled with cool things, or given in cool Waters, they can do no hurr. If the Stomach is much afflicted, and the Patient is troubled with Vomiting, you muſt underſtand that Nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to caſt out her enemy that way, &amp; ſhe ought to be aſſiſted by a Vomit. The gentler ſort, and ſuch as are to be choſen for weak people, is the Oyl of Almonds, or common Oyl given in Barly Water; you muſt give a Pint at the leaſt, or elſe it will hardly work the effect. Sirrup of Vinegar or Oxymel given in the Decoction of Radiſhes. Every day or every other day give an emollient and refrigerating Cliſter, ſuch as Barly, Mallows, Violet leavs, and Mercury.

               <head>CHAP. LXXXVI. <hi>Of the Hectick Feaver.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AN hectick Feaver occupies the ſolid parts of the Body, as well as the Spirits; it is an unnaturall Heat, of which the Patient is ſcarce ſenſible. This Feaver is either primary, and begins of it ſelf, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundary, and followeth ſome other Feaver. Some begin at the Heart, and ſome at other parts, as the Lungs, Liver, Spleen, Kidneys, Womb, or other parts inflamed. The cauſes of this Feaver are externall or internall; Externall cauſes are all that may occaſion any of the other Feavers. The Internall Cauſes are burning and peſtilentiall Feavers, which do ſpeedily conſume the Moiſture of the Heart; or ſome lingring Feaver. An Inflammation, Ulcer, Putrefaction of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the inward parts, may cauſe an hectick Heaver.</p>
               <p>An hectick Feaver is known eaſily, becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall, without encreaſing or decreaſing, ſaving a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after Meat; the Pulſe is little frequent and quick; the Arteryes are hotter then the other parts; the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine appeareth as of a healthy man, but after long continuance there is an Oyl ſwims on the top, and a Sediment like to Meal, which ſignifieth the Waſting of the Body.</p>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:115825:187"/>
               <p>An hectick Feaver may be cured, unleſſe it be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected till it come to the height, that is, when the Eyes are hollow, dry with dry Excrements, the Bones ſtick out, and the Colour of the Face is gone, the Skin is dry, and the Midriff ſo contracted as if the Patient had no Guts, then it is incurable.</p>
               <p>If the hectick Feaver depend upon the Diſeaſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other part, the Cure muſt be directed to that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe; and if it be joyned with any other Diſeaſe, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect muſt be had to that Diſeaſe. The Cure of the hectick conſiſteth more in a due obſervance of Diet, then in Medicines. His Diet muſt be cool &amp; moiſten, and ſoon nouriſh; as Chicken Broths, or Broth made of Hens, Capons, Veal, Kid, Mutton; in which boil French Barly, Lettice; Endive, Succory, Sorrell, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Purſlane, and ſuch like. The Fleſh of young Hares, Pheaſants, and young Partridges are good; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nados, Water Gruell, Barly cream, Rice pottage, with Almonds or the cold Seeds. Boiled Meat is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then roſted, and if the Patient eateth roſted Meat, let Oranges and Lemmons be his Sauce. For his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et likewiſe may be prepared, Gellyes made of Capons, Knuckles of Veal and Mutton, Calves Feet, Sheeps Feet, and ſuch like, adding Herbs or other Ingredients that are cooling, moiſtning, and cordiall. New laid Egs, boiled rear, are good; and of Fruit, Apples are much commended, eſpecially Pippins, becauſe they breed cold Blood. For his drink, let him uſe Barly Water with cooling Sirrups. <hi>Galen</hi> approveth of cold Water, with which he ſaith he hath ſaved many from the <hi>Maraſmos,</hi> which is the Conſumption of the radicall Moiſture of the Body, which commonly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth this Diſeaſe. Great care is to be uſed in the giving of cold Water, to decayed people, leſt the heat of the Patient ſhould be wholly extinguiſhed. Motion
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:115825:187"/> and much Stirring, and Labour, is not good, yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Exerciſe before Meat may be allowed of: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Excrciſes, let him beware of the Under-ſheet. Let his Sleep be moderated; if he be coſtive, provoke a Stool by a Suppoſitory, or gentle Cliſters. Purges are not to be allowed of, becauſe the Body hath more need of repairing then weakning: yet if the Body be full of Excrements, you may venture to give gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Purgers, as Caſſia, Manna, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Cooling and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Juleps, ſuch as are preſcribed in the Chapter before going, the Patient make uſe of, but let him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the too frequent uſe of them, leſt they diminiſh his Heat too much. Such Epithems, Unguents, or Oyles mentioned in the aforegoing Chapter, are good to temper the Heat of the Lover. Laſtly, ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, mentioned in the former Chapter, as ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Nature and revive the Spirits may be uſed, and there is need enough thereof. The worſt Symptome that can attend this Diſeaſe is a Looſeneſſe: if it ſo happen, give Goats or Cows Milk wherein Steel hath been quenched, or Rice boild in it, or Sirrup of Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces given with the Decoction of French Barly parched, or ſuch like.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LXXXVII. <hi>Of the Tertian Ague.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis Diſeaſe is divided into an Exquiſite and Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard Tertian; the exquiſite is terminated in 12 hours; but a baſtard laſteth lenger: if it exceed twenty four hours it is called <hi>Tertiana extenſa,</hi> a Terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an extended.</p>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:115825:188"/>
               <p>The Tertian Ague is Simple, Double, or Triple; the Simple is that which cometh every other day; the Double Tertian cometh every day, and ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from the Quotidian in its proper place; and ſometimes the Patient hath two Fits in one day. The Triple Tertian is when the Patient hath three Fits in two dayes.</p>
               <p>Choller and ſuch things as engender it, are the cauſe of this Diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a hot and dry Diſtemper of the Spleen, youthfull Age, hot Air, Watchings, Cares, Anger, Faſtings, uſe of hot Meats, and overmuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. Thoſe that have hot Livers, that eat and drink liberally, and ſuch things as breed Crudityes, Phlegm, and melancholy Humours, are ſubject to baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard Tertians, by reaſon of the Mixture of Choller with the Crudityes.</p>
               <p>The exquiſite Tertian doth alwayes begin with ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the Quotidian begins with a light Shivering or Coldneſſe. After the cold Fit, followeth great Heat, ſharp biting and intolerable Thirſt, and ſometimes all the Symptomes of a putrid Tertian Feaver. In the baſtard Tertian all the foregoing Signes appear, but more remiſſe, and more vehement then a Quotidian; according as more or leſſe Phlegm is mingled with the Choller, this Diſeaſe cometh nearer to a Quotidian, or exquiſite Tertian.</p>
               <p>A Legitimate Tertian ſeldom laſteth above ſeven dayes, and is not dangerous, unleſſe ſome Malignity be joyned with it; and the Patient be of a healthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and temperate in eating, and drinking; judg the contrary, if the Patient is otherwiſe qualifyed. If the Patient's Lips break out with Scabs, or if he fall into a Looſeneſſe theſe are good Signes; for Nature is turning out the Enemy.</p>
               <p>To work the Cure, a cooling Diet muſt be appointed,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:115825:188"/> and withall moiſtning, ſuch as hath been preſcribed in the Cure of continuall Feavers, the ſame you muſt obſerve in the double Tertian. But in the baſtard and Single Tertian, a fuller Diet is to be obſerved. What ever the Patient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ateth let him eat nothing before the Fit, two or three hours, that there may be a digeſture; but it is good if he go to Stool before the Fit, to help the ſame give a Cliſter.</p>
               <p>Cliſters, in an exquiſite Tertian, muſt be made of emollient and cooling Decoctions, adding Caſſia, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicon, Diaprunum lenitive and ſolutive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a baſtard Tertian let the Decoction be emollient and cutting, and diſſolve in it Diaphaenicon, Hony of Roſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Purgatives ought to be the ſame for the exquiſite Tertian, as for the continuall Feavers. In the Baſtard, add Agarick, Catholicum, Diaphaenicon, Sena, and ſuch as the judicious Phyſitian ſhall judg ſuitable, in reſpect of the Patient's Conſtitution, and the Humors offending. But to every Medicine cream of Tartar may be added, for it openeth, cleanſeth, and cools. If the Patient be ſubject to vomit, go that way to work as I ſaid in the laſt Chapter. Open a Vein &amp; draw Blood as often, or as much, as you ſee occaſion. Prepare the Humours with Juleps, as you are taught in the laſt Chapter, then purge. If the Humours be ſtubborn, and the Fit continue, make a Decoction of Wormwood and Century, with cool Herbs to qualify the Heat, it is much commended; after the uſe of that purge again. If there be a Diſtenſion under the ſhort Ribs, apply an emollient, attenuating, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Fomentation. What ever part of the Body is ill diſpoſed, have a regard to that in all your Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. The Spirit of Sulphur is much magnified, for extinguiſhing the Heat of Feavers, and if the Humours be thin it ſends them forth by Sweat: give from half a
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:115825:189"/> Scruple to a Scruple in four Ounces of Purſlane Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Or you may give it thus: <hi>Take of Salt of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, half a Drathm: Spirit of Sulphur, a Scruple: Carduus Water, four Ounces: mix them, and give the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to drink, when the Fit approcheth, and lay him to ſweat.</hi> Thoſe things, which are uſually laid to the Wriſts by the common people, are not to be deſpiſed, I ſhall not inſert them, nor more Receipts, for the cure of this Ague; Firſt, it being my cheifeſt end to deſcribe the Cauſes and Signes of Diſeaſes; Secondly, almoſt every womans Head is full of Medicines againſt an Ague.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THis Ague is cauſed by Phlegm putrefying in the firſt Region of the Body: therefore all things that breed Phlegm in the Body may be the Cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p>The Diagnoſtick ſignes are ſuch as teſtify Phlegm to abound in the Body, as white colour, pale, dull Senſe, Softneſſe and Fatneſſe, Profoundneſſe of Sleep, and Droaming of Water. It comes with a cold ſhlvering, little or noe ſhaking; and for the moſt part it comes in the Night. After the cold Fit the Patient feels Heat but mildly, not ſcorching, little Thirſt: the Pulſe is ſmall, ſeldom, and ſlow; there is a Diſtenſion about the ſhort Ribs: the Fits appear more intenſe or remiſſe, laſt longer or ſhotter, as the Phlegm is ſimple or mingled with other Humours: the Fit commonly laſteth twelv hours, and then leaveth a feavouriſh Fit
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:115825:189"/> behind it. Sometimes it laſteth twenty four hours, and is almoſt like a continuall Feaver. There is a difference found in reſpect of the Nature of the Phlegm, for ſalt Phlegm makes the Patient thirſty; ſharp Phlegm, hungry; ſweet Phlegm, ſleepy: If the Phlegm hath no Taſt, it maketh him without Appetite. Acid or glaſſy Phlegm (by reaſon of its Coldneſſe) cauſeth ſhaking. This Diſeaſe for the moſt part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth long, and is not without danger, becauſe it ſometimes degenerates into a Cachexia, Dropſy, or Lethargy.</p>
               <p>The Diet and Medicines muſt be ſuch as have an extenuating, cutting, and dividing Quality. The Cure muſt be performed almoſt in the ſame Manner, as the baſtardly Tertian: <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> doth much commend the Decoction of Roman Wotmwood and Camomill Flowers, if five or ſix Ounces be adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And the Decoction of China and Guajacum for many dayes, but beware it dry not too much.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LXXXIX. <hi>Of the Quartane Ague.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AN intermitting Quartane is cauſed of Melancholy putrifying in the Body.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of Quartan Agues, <hi>viz.</hi> a Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and a Baſtard Quartane: a Legitimate is bred of naturall Melancholy, which is the carthly part of our Nouriſhment, in quality cold and dry. The baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard Quartane is bred of preternaturall Melancholy, which is bred of aduſt Choller, and is hot and dry, or by Melancholy mixed with aduſt Choller. A Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:115825:190"/> Ague is either ſingle, double, or triple, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle is that which comes every fourth day. The dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is when two Fits happen upon two dayes one after another, and the third day none. The Triple Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane is when Fits come every as in a Quotidian, and double Tertian.</p>
               <p>Diagnoſtick Signes of a Quartane, are, the Ague coming every fourth day, and Melancholy abounding in the Body: it begins with gaping and ſtretching, heavineſſe of the Body; ſhivering and ſhaking follows, as if it would break the Patient's Bones. The Pulſe is ſeldom and ſlow: the Urine watry, thin, and white, after a while it is higher coloured and thicker. The baſtard Quartane (for the moſt part) follows other Feavers or Agues, by which Aduſtion of Humours is made; and in it the Feaver, Heat and Thirſt, is more violent, and all the Symptomes are greater, becauſe the Humours are thinner. A double Quartane is known by the courſe of the Fits. A triple Quartane is diſtinguiſhed from a double Tertian, or Quotidian, by Melancholy abounding; and by the courſe of the Fits; and chiefly in this, that at firſt it was a ſimple or double Quartane.</p>
               <p>Prognoſticks are thus made: This of all Agues is the longeſt of Continuance, ſome continue half a year, ſome a year, and ſome longer. It is good in this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue for the Patient to void black Urine. The baſtard Quartane is not of ſo long continuance as the Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, becauſe it proceeds from thinner Humours then the other. The Legitimate is not ſo dangerous as the other, which hath many times dangerous Symptomes, eſpecially if the Liver, Spleen, or any of the interior parts, be damnified, becauſe it is ſometimes degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a Dropſy. If any aged above ſixty fall into the Quartane Ague, it proveth mortall. If the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:115825:190"/> Quartane degenerate into a continuall, it is for the moſt part deadly. To bleed at the Noſe in a Quartane Ague is but a bad Sign, becauſe the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick Humours are too thick for ſuch an Evacuation.</p>
               <p>If a bloody Flux come upon a Quartane Ague and continue but a while, it is good.</p>
               <p>A baſtard Quartane is cured almoſt with the ſame Medicines, which have been preſcribed for the Cure of a Tertian; to them adding ſuch Medicines as regard Melancholy, and free the Spleen from Diſaffection.</p>
               <p>Seeing the Legitimate Quartane is cauſed of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that are cold and dry, thick and earthly, we muſt uſe Medicines that do heat, moiſten, and attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate. Let the Patient's Diet be heating and moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, of good Juyce, eaſy of digeſture, and of thin ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: as rear Egs, yong Animals, and Birds of Mountains, Fiſhes of ſtony Rivers: among Herbs, Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Bugloſſe, Spinach, Fennell, Parſly, and Turneps; <hi>Crato</hi> doth much commend the Broth of Turneps: of Fruits, Almonds, Apples, ſtewed Prunes, Figs, Raiſons, Dates, and Pine-kernells. Let him abſtain from all Meats, which are of a thick and clammy Subſtance, and of hard digeſture: let him drink ſmall Ale or Beer; let him eat moderately, and on the Fit day, ſix hours before the Fit cometh: let him be very moderate in drinking, for much drink fills the Spleen and makes the Diſeaſe rebellious. Having thus ordered his Diet, give him a gentle Purgation by Cliſter: <hi>Take of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Camomill, Mercury, and Beets, of each, one Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: Polypody of the Oak, an Ounce and an half: Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimum, half an Ounce: of the four greater cold Seeds, and of Annis, and Fennell, of each, two Drachms: boil it in Poſſet drink to a Pint: ſtrainit, diſſolve therein Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicon and Hony of Roſes, of each, one Ounce: the Oyls of Violets and Camomill, of each, one Ounce and an half,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:115825:191"/> mix all and make a Cliſter.</hi> Then purge the Melancholy Humour by ſome gentle Medicine, beware of a ſtrong purge in the beginning before Concoction, leſt you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the Humours, and turn the Diſeaſe to a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall, or at leaſt to a Double or Triple Quartane. Make a gentle Purgation thus: <hi>Take of Fumitory, Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſe, &amp; Maiden-hair, of each, one Handfull: Polypody of the Oak, Liquoriſh, and ſweet Fennell Seed, of each, half an Ounce: boil them; when they are boiled, infuſe or gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boil half an Ounce of Senna, till the Liquor come to three or four Ounces: diſſolve therein Manna, and Sirrup of Roſes, of each, one Ounce, for a Potion: give it the next day after the Cliſter.</hi> After purgeing open a Vein in the left Arm, unleſſe you find the Liver out of order, then you muſt open a Vein in the right Arm; if the Blood be black and impure, draw the more, Moſt do let Blood upon the well-day, ſome will have it done on the Fit-day before the Fit, becauſe the Humours then begin to ſtirr: <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> will have it done when the Moon is at the full, becauſe, by the Moons Influence, the earthy and melancholy Humour is made more fluid and apt to come away. It is good to open the Haemorrhoids, if your Patient hath been inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that Evacuation: if your Patient be a Woman, provoke the Menſtrues if they be ſtopped, and open the <hi>Saphaena.</hi> The opening of the <hi>Vena Salvatella</hi> is much approved of. Likewiſe you muſt make Decoctions, Broths or Juleps to prepare and concoct the Humours; for which purpoſe theſe Simples are good, <hi>viz.</hi> the five opening Roots, and the Root of Succory, Liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and Bugloſſe: Bark of Tamarisk: The Leavs of Burrage, Bugloſſe, Ceterach, Maiden-hair, Fumitory, Germander, ground-Pine, Wormwood, and Century, the three cordiall Flowers: of theſe you may make Decoctions, and ſweeten them with Sirrupus Bizantius
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:115825:191"/> or Sirrup of Maiden-hair. After the uſe of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives purge the melancholy Humour; and between the dayes you purge, give a Cliſter, this obſerving, that you often change your Medicines, and continue in the courſe a long time; for the melancholy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is not ſoon evacuated; and that is the reaſon that ſo few are cured of this Diſeaſe, becauſe few will obſerve the Rule of the Phyſitian, or have patience to take his Medicines.</p>
               <p>Vomits, in the beginning of this Feaver, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by all; of Aſarum, a Drachm given in white-Wine, is of an excellent Faculty. In the declination of the Diſeaſe, Diaphoreticks may be given to diſcuſſe the reliques of the Diſeaſe, the Decoction of the Roots of China &amp; Sarſa are good, and Venice-Treacle hath great virtue. You may anoint the back-Bone with a Liniment made of ſome of theſe Oyls, <hi>viz.</hi> of Dill, Camomill, Orice, Coſtus, Rue, Bayes, and Spike in a ſmall Quantity: mixing with them, Treacle, Cloves, Muſtard Seed, Caſtoreum, and the like; of theſe an ingenious Man may compound a Liniment to anoint the Back bone, one hour before the Fit; then lay him to Bed, and lay hot Tyles, wrapt in cloaths, to his Feet and Hands, and lay him in a Sweat. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, great care ought to be had of the Spleen, for in this Diſeaſe the Spleen is diſaffected, and obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: The 59 Chapter will furniſh you with ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>

               <p>HAving briefly treated of moſt Diſeaſes that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of man is incident to, I thought it convenient to write a word or two of the Peſtilence. But conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how many larger Treatiſes thereof are at this day extant, I could have willingly omitted it, but hoping my Mite will not onely be acceptable but beneficiall, I thought good to epitomize this as well as the reſt.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe afflicteth Nature, not onely by a bare Diſtemper or Heat ariſing from Putrefaction, but alſo by a malignant and venemous Quality: by which means it becomes popular and epidemicall. Before we goe any farther, know that thoſe Feavers which we call malignant or peſtilentiall, vulgarly ſpotted Feavers, are of the ſame kind with the Peſtilence, and are cured by the ſame means. The cauſes of the Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence are either internall or externall; the internall cauſes are immediate, or mediate: The Immediate cauſe is a Corruption of the Humours with Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the venemous Quality is bred of Corruption, and from Putrefaction the Feaver is bred. The Mediate cauſes are Fulneſſe of Blood which Nature cannot maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but eaſily turnes to Putrefaction: Abundance of evill Humours is eaſily corrupted and putrified: to theſe, joyn Obſtructions, which is a great means to breed ſuch Diſeaſes; for ſuch Humours, cloſe ſhut up in the Body, and having no Evacuation not Transſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, muſt of neceſſity putrify. But Obſtruction is not a principall cauſe of this Diſeaſe, for the venemous
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:115825:192"/> Quality is received by drawing in of the Air, by which Venom the Humours are changed from their naturall condition, and, of their own accord, putrify. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Cauſes are, Firſt, the Air, which becomes hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to men, firſt, if it be not blown through with wholeſome Winds, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> obſerveth, ſpeaking of a grievous peſtilentiall year, that in that year there were few Winds. Secondly, the Air may be vitious by putrid Exhalations, as of Lakes, Pools, Fiſh-ponds, or other ſtanding Waters, or from Bodyes unburied, which have been ſlain in Battail. Thirdly, the Air may become hurtfull by Exceſſe, or the praepoſterous condition of the firſt Qualityes, as Exceſſe of Heat, Cold, Drithe, or Moiſture, of which I could lay down manifold Examples, which befit not my ſmall Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume. Inequalityes of Seaſons muſt be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a cauſe, when it is ſometimes hot and ſometimes cold, ſometimes dry and ſuddenly Moiſture follows; one while vehemently hot, and ſuddenly very cold; or after a violent wet and moiſt time, a ſudden and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Drouth: a hot Winter and a cold Summer. Next to vitious Air, is a bad Aliment and Diet, when the Fruits of the Earth, by a bad Temperature of the Air, are corrupted; or when, by reaſon of Scarcity, the Poor are fain to feed on unwholeſome Diet, (whence the proverb came, the Plague followeth the Famine) or a great Plenty following a Famine, when the poor gorge themſelves, which, for want of Heat and a good Diſpoſition of Body, cannot be digeſted, but turns to Putrefaction. Add to theſe the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Influence of <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Signes, by which the Conſtitution of the Air and the Bodyes of men are changed and corrupted: for all Philoſophers by common conſent acknowledge, that inferiour Be dyes are governed by the heavenly
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:115825:193"/> Conſtellations: To this kind we muſt add the defects and Eclipſes of the Sun and Moon, and unuſuall Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, eſpecally blazing Starrs. Above all cauſes, let us not be unmindfull of the ſtrict &amp; ſevere Judgment of God, for the ſinnes of Mankind: For many times he is pleaſed to puniſh our Sins and Offences by this Judgment; as the Scriptures do frequently prove. To theſe non-naturall cauſes afore mentioned, we muſt add the Retention of Womens Courſes, the Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids in men, or ſome uſuall Evacuation, Idleneſſe, or too much Sleep, Anger, Sadneſſe, or other Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind.</p>
               <p>Signes, that ſhew the Peſtilence approaching, are taken from the preſence of Cauſes before mentioned. Thoſe Bodyes are diſpoſed to receive peſtilentiall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which have collected evill Juyces and Diet, and have had a praepoſterous uſe of the non-naturall things afore ſpecifyed. The cheif Signes, which ſhew the Body to be infected; the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>art is much afflicted, Cardialgia, and Heart-burning, and pain about the Mouth of the Stomach: ſometimes great Thirſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Meaſure of the Patient's Heat; ſomtimes Want of Thirſt, yet a vehement Feaver and Drineſſe of the Tongue: Want of Appetire and abhorring of all Meat, and vomiting up what ever Food, Drink, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps, or Emulſions is given, and their Thirſt continue, and the Tongue black: A frequent and inordinate ſhivering, which comes divers times in a day: Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Heavineſſe of the whole Body: Pains of the Head, Watchings, and Ravings: Some are very drouſy and ſleepy, then judge that the Brain is full of phlegmatick Excrements. To ſome there happen cholerick Fluxes, which ſtink very much. Frequent Sweats, ſmall, ſhort, and unprofitable, do break forth: the Heat is mild and gentle to the Feet, becauſe the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:115825:193"/> Diſeaſe is cauſed rather by a malignant and venemous Quality, then by Putrefaction. Redneſſe of the eyes, and ſometimes a frowning or a furious look. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times abmndance of Worms are voided, which ſhew a great Putrefaction. The Urine is ſometimes like the Urine of a ſound man, if a malignant Quality doth rather offend then Putrefaction: ſometimes it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thick, troubled, and high coloured, and hath a thick, red, and ſcattered Sediment. On ſome, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Spots like Flea-bitings: Carbuncles, and Riſings in the Groin, behind the Ears, and under the Atm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits. Thoſe Spots upon the Bodyes of the dead, which are of a Lead-colour or black, do eſpecially denote the Peſtilence.</p>
               <p>No certain Prognoſtick can be drawn of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, therefore the diſcreet Phyſitian ought to ſuſpend his Judgment of the iſſue thereof: For many have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, notwithſtanding many hopes and teſtimonyes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; and, on the contrary, many have eſcaped, with moſt mortall ſignes. Yet it is lawfull for the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian to give his conjecture thus; If the Pulſe keep a Tenor and equality there is ſome hopes; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if it be inordinate, unequall, and contracted, it is dangerous. If the Pulſe be like the Pulſe of an healthy perſon, it is dangerous; becauſe it is a ſign that Nature doth not labour to concoct the Humours, for her own deliverance. Raving is not dangerous if it be leſſened by Sleep, but if it turn to dotage, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, there is little hope. Contractions, convulſive and trembling Motions are deadly, for it ſhews that the Brain is mortally wounded, and that Nature is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by the Diſeaſe. Deafneſſe at the beginning is dangerous: but in the ſtate of the Diſeaſe, it is not ſo, for many times health follows. Sneezing is lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. Heart-burnings. Hiccoughs, and extream
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:115825:194"/> Loathing, do portend danger, and that the Stomach is over maſtered by the Malignant quality of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. Suppreſſion of all Evacuations, in the beginning and ſtate of the Diſeaſe, is good, provided that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity doth not ſettle in the head, or near any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part. The Urine that is like the Urine of a heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſon is bad; the ſame judge, if they be thin, thick, confuſed or troubled. Urines which have a laudable ſediment, and well concoct are good, and ſhew a ſtrong naturall Faculty to expell the Venome. An Urine, black or blew, fat and oyly, with a black or blewiſh ſetling, ſhews a waſting of the Body, and is a deadly Sign. Sweats ſeldom portend good, though it happens on a criticall day, unleſſe it doth much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the Feaver. Sometimes, a Looſeneſſe of the Belly, at the beginning, is good, and ſometimes it is a deadly Sign. Spots, the more laudable the colour is, the better, if they be black, or Lead-colour, and go in again it is dangerous. Carbuncles and Buboes, the farther from the Heart, the better, and the ſooner they ripen, the ſafer.</p>
               <p>The Cure ought to be two-fold, firſt, to preſerve thoſe from it who have it not; ſecondly, in healing thoſe that have it. Firſt, to preſerve, take away the cauſes both internall and externall. If the Body be pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, let Phlebotomy abate it: If full of evill Humours let them be purged: If obſtructed, let means be uſed to open Obſtructions. If the Body be in a good ſtate, labour to keep it ſo. If it be too moiſt, babour to dry it, and avoid all moiſt Nouriſhments, and much drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eat no Fiſh, Meats made of Milk, nor Herbs; walk not in the South Air, or neer Lakes, nor in the Night, fleep not too much. If the Body be weak uſe a reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Diet. If the Air be too hot; labour to cool it, as we taught you, in continual Feavers, if it be too moiſt
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:115825:194"/> correct it by fires and fumes, as alſo to conſume and diſſipate the infection of the Ayre: make fires and fumes of ſweet Woods, and other ſweet ſented ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, as Cypreſſe, Wood of Aloes, Juniper; Storax, Labdanum, Mirrhe, Benjamin, yellow Sanders, Ireos, Storax, Frankinſence, Cinnamon, Cloves, Red-Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves, Calamint, Bayes, Roſemary, and ſuch like. Let the common ſort of people, and the poorer ſort, carry Rue and Angelica to ſmell to, and take in the morning faſting, and when they go abroad, <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date</hi>'s medicine; Mithridate, Venice-Treacle, and ſuch like. Let the Rich man uſe of this Pomander. <hi>Take of Labdanum, and of the Rinds of Citrons, of each one drachm: of the three kinds of Sanders, of each half a drachme; Wood of Aloes, flowers of Bugloſſe, Nenuphar, Roſe leaves, of each two Scruples, a lipta Muſcatae, half a ſcruple; Cloves and Marjoram, of each one ſcruple; Zedoary root one ſcruple; Benjamin one drachm; Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax Calamita one drachm and an half, Camphir half a drachme: Musk and Ambergreece of each ſour Grains; Powder them, and with the Muſilage of Gum-dragant made in Roſe-water, make a Pomander.</hi> and let them make uſe of this Preſervative: <hi>Take of Bolearmenick prepared half an ounce, of Cinnamon three drachms, of white Dittany, the roots of Angelica, Gentian, and Tormentill, of each two drachms, the root of Zedoary, Red Roſes, of all the Sanders, Harts-Horn, the leaves of Scabious, and flowers of Bugloſſe, of each one drachme, of Juniper-berries, Nutmegs, and bone of a Stags Heart, of each half a drachm; of Pearls prepared two Scruples, of Saphir, Jacinth, Emerauld, Ruby and Granate prepared, and leaf-Gold, of each one ſcruple; powder them all, and with Syrrup of Vinegar or Lemons, make an Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and take a Scruple or two in the Morning.</hi>

               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:115825:195"/>
               <p>For the cure of thoſe that are ſick, let the ſame courſe of Diet be obſerved, as was preſcribed in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall Feavers; and it the body be plethorick, open a Vein; How much bloud to take away, and how often to bleed, let prudence be your director. If you judge it neceſſary, apply Cupping-glaſſes to the ſhoulders, back, and hips; and veſicatories applyed to the neck and Arm-pits, and Groyns, are ſeldome without admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſucceſſe; and a Cataplaſme of Snails, or Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, laid to the feet are good. Firſt, altering Juleps, are good to prepare the humours, made of ſuch things as are preſcribed for the Cure of continual Feavers; to which add Antidotes, which have a ſpecifick proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to fight againſt the venemous quality: as the roots of Tormentill, Cinkfoil, Scorzonera, white Thiſtle; the leaves of Scordium, Carduus, Scabious, Meddow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweet, Flowers of Marigolds; Lemons and Citrons, Odoriferous Apples, Harts-horn; the juice or Syr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Lemons, Pomegranats, Citrons, Vinegar, the ſpirit of Sulphur and Vitriol. In the whole courſe of the cure, Antidotes muſt be given, of which there are four ſorts, or degrees, the firſt reſiſt the venemous quality, and beſides are cold, dry, and aſtringent, by which they ſtrengthen the Heart, hinder putrefaction, and the venom, from ſpreading over the body: of this ſort are Bolearmenick, Terra Sigillata, the roots of Biſtort, Cinkfoil, Tormentill, &amp;c. The ſecond ſort, by their coldneſſe and tenuity, do reſiſt putrefaction, and reſtrain the venemous quality: as the juice of Lemons, ſpirit of Sulphur and Vitrioll, and all other acid things. The third ſort are ſuch as are hot and Diaphoretick, which expel the venome from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Circumference, from the Heart, to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, by ſweat, and of this ſort are Angelica, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doary, Dictamnus, Meddow-ſweet, Scordium, Cardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:115825:195"/> Scabious, Treacle, Mithridate, Treacle-water. The laſt ſort are ſuch, as by a ſpeciall quality, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, do oppoſe the venemous quality, as Bezoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, Harts-horn, Unicorns-horn, Troches of Vipers, and ſuch like. Of theſe, and Simples of the like nature, may many Medicines be compoſed, which muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly varied and mixed, according to the different degree of malignity, and putrefaction, according to the intenſion and remiſſion of the Feaver, according to the divers Temperaments, Sex, and Age of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, the determination of which depends not upon any certain rules, but upon the Prudence and head-piece of an able Phyſitian. In the Malignant and ſpotted Feaver, if putrefaction be greater then the vonemous quality; the medicines of the firſt, ſecond, or fourth order, do beſt agree in the beginning and Augment of the Feaver: and thoſe of the third, viz. Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and ſweating medicines in the declination; but if it be the Plague, and the venemous quality exceed the putrefaction; let Diaphoreticks be uſed firſt: as for the forms of particular medicines, let the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an vary them according to the different degree of heat, putrefaction, and malignity. Let the Phyſitian take care to ſtrengthen the Heart, alſo, by outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of Cordiall Epithems; and let the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles and Borches be ſuppurated, broken, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by the expert Chirurgious Art.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XCI. <hi>Of the Small Pox and Meaſels.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Feaver which attends the Small Pox and Meaſels, may be juſtly termed Peſtilential, for it is epidemicall, contagious and many times mortall: I need not write any thing of the difference between theſe two, viz. Pox, and Meaſols, for every Woman knows it. There is another ſort of Puſtules come out upon children like bladders, without inflammation or redneſſe, and without a Feaver: ſome Phyſitians call it the Cryſtalls, we call it the Bliſters. The cauſe of the ſmall Pox and Meaſells, was in the Mothers Bloud, with which the child was nouriſhed in the Womb, and is hence chiefly gathered, becauſe among thouſands of men, it is hard to find one, who once in his life hath not had theſe diſeaſes. For in the blood be it never ſo pure, ſome impurities are found, which doth communicate pollution to the parts of the child, and defile the Maſſe of bloud; and being provoked by ſome occaſion, (<hi>viz.</hi> a certain diſpoſition of Ayre, proportionable to the diſeaſe) the bloud boils and purifieth it ſelf and the parts, and the impurity is caſt forth. Underſtand that theſe impurities do not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially remain in the body, for then they would corrupt in a little time, but an evill quality is by them imprinted upon the parts. When this ebullition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth, the excrement is twofold, either thin or thick; if thin, the Meaſels follow; if thick, the ſmall Pox. And another reaſon is this, Sometimes the Air is inclinable to the one, and ſometimes to the other.
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:115825:196"/> Again, the Pox is either Perfective or corruptive; the Perfective is when the corrupt, impure, and excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious part of the bloud, is caſt forth by nature, the reſt remaining pure, and the Patient is reſtored with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Phyſick: the corruptive Pox, is not onely the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt bloud purged forth, but the moſt pure bloud cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, which is occaſioned by a malignant conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ayre, and ſo produceth a dangerous and Epidemicall Pox, which is ſometimes a forerunner of the Plague. In reſpect of the naturall conſtitution of the body they come forth more or leſſe, ſooner or later, and ſometimes they ſeize upon the internal as well as external parts, as the throat, Lungs, Guts, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Spleen, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Signes which declare the Pox at hand, are pain in the head, and beating about the Temples, troubled and terrified in ſleep, ſometimes ravings and Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, hoarſneſſe, cough, and difficulty of breathing; heat and pricking all over the body, pain of the back, ſhining before the eyes, the face red and ſwelled. If they come out ſoon, and eaſily ripen, there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the ſame judge if the ſymptomes are not great, and the voice and breathing is free. If they come out red, afterwards white, round, pointed, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in the skin, there is no danger. The contrary to theſe are ſigns of a deadly and dangerous Pox, viz. a great Feaver, which is not abated at their comming out, difficulty of breathing, great thirſt, a looſneſſe or bloody flux, becauſe the malignant humours have their recourſe inward; which is contrary to nature a bloudy Urine, or ſtool, bleeding at the Noſe, Gums, or other parts, are commonly deadly ſigns, for they ſignify the extream acrimony and malignancy of the Bloud, that nature is forced to void it in ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous way. Pox long comming out, ſhews the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115825:197"/> contumacy of the Humour, or Weakneſſe of Nature, if they be many, great, double, and united, they ſhew abundance of Humours: hard ones ſhew the Thickneſs of the Matter: flat ones ſhew the Weakneſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive Faculty: if there be a black Spot in the middle it ſhews the malignity of the Humours; the like judge, if they be green, blewiſh, or black, and they are all bad Signes; but it is worſe if they ſink, go in, and the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor falleth, for it ſignifieth the Retirement of the Humours inward, and few in this condition eſcape. If black or blew Spots come forth among the Pox, it ſhews great Malignity; and the Patient in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. If the Excrements and Urine be black or livid, they ſignify abundance of Melancholy, and great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>For the Cure, keep the Patient in a warm room, and if you tender his life, keep out the cold Air, leſt the Humours be driven inward. Keep the Cloaths cloſe about him, but let them not ly too heavy. Let his drink be Barly-Water, and boil therein Sorrell Roots and Harts-horn, and Figs, if the Feaver be not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: let his Sleep be moderate. Phyſitians, for the moſt part, adviſe the Cure to begin with blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that is, if the Patient be full of Blood, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing forbid it; but it muſt be done before, or juſt as they be coming forth. Purges are abſolutely forbidden; but if the body be very coſtive, move it with a Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, but do not provoke it. Then endeavour the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of the Matter, thus; <hi>Take of the Roots of graſs, Aſparagus, and Fennell, of each, four Ounces: Liquoriſh, half an Ounce: Wood Sorrell, two Handfulls: twenty Figs: the cordiall Flowers, one Pugill: make a Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Pint, towards the latter end, put in a little Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron; take four Ounces Night and Morning.</hi> Bezar and Gaſcoins powder is good to ſend out the Pox, and for
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:115825:197"/> Children <hi>Diaſcordium</hi> is a familiar Medicine. We muſt endeavour to preſerve the internall parts; if you fear that the Liver, Spleen, or Guts, ſhould ſuffer, to the former Decoction, add husked Lentils, two drams, Gum Lac, and Traganth, of each, one Drachm. You muſt defend the Eyes with the Water of Roſes and Plantane, and infuſe Camphir, Saffron, and if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation be great, infuſe Tutty. You muſt defend the Lungs with the Conſerve of Roſes and Violets, the Sirrup of Violets, Jujubees, Myrtles, dried Roſes, Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyes, and ſuch like. You muſt defend the Throat with a Gargle of Oxycrate; or you may make it with Plantane Water and Sirrup of Mulberryes or Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates. To defend the Noſe, put up a <hi>Nodulus,</hi> made of Vinegar, Roſe-Water, and the Powder of Sanders and Camphir. When the Pox are out, full ripe, and begin to break, anoint them often with the Oyl of Almonds, it will be a means to prevent their pitting; and where there are likely to be holes anoint with the Oyl of the yolks of Egs.</p>

               <p>A Wound is a breach of Continuity, freſh and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without Putrefaction or Matter: It is cauſed by a Sword, Bullet, Arrow, or ſuch like, which the Chirurgion may eaſily perceive. Wounds in the fleſh are eaſily cured; in the Nervs, Veins, and Arteryes, they are not without danger: In the inſtrumentall &amp; principall parts, as the Heart, Liver, Lungs, Brain, Spleen, Midriff, Wezand, Stomach, Guts, or Bladder, are deadly. A Feaver, Perturbation, Swooning, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, and ſuch like Symptomes are dangerous.</p>
               <p>The Cure muſt be directed, firſt to the cauſe; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:115825:198"/> to the Wound itſelf; thirdly, to the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; laſtly, to the Symptomes attending.

The Simples availeable and of force for the purpoſe aforeſaid are, <hi>The Roots of Reeds and Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort; the Leavs of Dittany, Crow-foot, Miſſletoe, Thap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia; Sagapenum, Ammoniacum, Opopanax, Quick Lime, burnt Frogs, Galbanum, Bears greaſe, the Load-ſtone, Muſtard-Seed, and ſuch like.</hi> Of theſe and ſuch like you may prepare compound Medicines: This Unguent of <hi>Veſalus</hi> is much approved of: <hi>Take of Rozin of the Pine tree, two Ounces: Galbanum, three Ounces: of the Stone called Calamites, one Ounce: the Gall of an Ox, one Ounce and an half: of Turpetine, three Ounces; New Wax, two Ounces: firſt, ſtrain out the Wax, Rozin, and Turpetine; after, mix the Golbanum, Gall, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Stone, and make an Unguent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Plaiſter is likewiſe good for the ſame purpoſe: <hi>Take of Leaven, one pound: Oyl, half a pound: the juyce of Knot-graſſe, and Dittany, (or, for want of it, the Powder of the dried Herbs,) of each, three Ounces: Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petine, one pound: The Bird Lime made of Miſſletoe Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, Ammoniacum, &amp; Galbanum and diſſolved in wine, of each, one Ounce; of Wax, four Ounces: mix them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fire, and make a Plaiſter.</hi>

               <p>Having thus far proceded, and removed all things unnaturall from the Wound, then muſt the Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if the Solution be great, artificially join the gaping ſides of the Wound by Seam, Taches, or ſtiching cloths and ſuch like, which I omit, and ſhall lay down a few Rules to prevent pain, Inflammation, or other unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Accidents, which may happen to the wounded part, or whole Body.</p>
               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:115825:199"/>
               <p>Inflammation is reſtrained by taking away the Cauſe of the Fluxion: Now the Humours, flowing to the part, are either drawn or ſent. They are drawn by reaſon of the Pain and Heat of the Member, which doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Humours to it ſelf. They are ſent, thus; when the whole Body is full of evill Humours, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part disburtheneth it ſelf upon the weaker. The Inflammation of the Part muſt be allayed with ſuch Medicines that quench Heat; and the Body muſt be purged, and ſuch a Courſe of Diet uſed as may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what free the Body from ſuch Humours, which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive and burthenſome to Nature.</p>
               <p>But before I come to treat of the removeall of ſuch Accidents and evill Symptoms; I ſhall briefly ſhew you the manner of Cure, which ought thus to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. After cloſing of the Wound, dreſſe it with ſome agglutinative Medicine, made of ſuch Simples: <hi>viz. Frankincenſe, Maſtich, Aloes, Rolearmenick, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis Draconis, Sarcocolla, Terra Sigillata, Balauſtines, Pomegranate Rinds, Cypreſſe Nuts, Galls, Horſe-tail, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, and ſuch like.</hi> You may make a Balm thus: <hi>Take of Turpetine, a pound: of Galbanum, Gum Elemy, Gum of Ivy, Frankincenſe, Maſtich, Myrrh, of each, two Ounces: Aloes, Lignum Aloes, Galanga, Nutmegs, Cloves, Cinnamon, Cubebs, of each, one Ounce: Aqua Vitae, three Ounces; infuſe and distill them to a Balm.</hi> After the Application of this or the like Balſome, lay on this Plaiſter: <hi>Take of Ammoniacum diſſolved in Vinegar, two Ounces: Gum Elemy, three Ounces: Rozin of the Pine tree, five Ounces: Turpentine of the Fir-tree, three oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Oyl of Roſes, two Ounces:</hi> make a Plaiſter. Open it once in twenty four hours till it be whole: thus may you cure a ſimple Wound in the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>If the Wound be hollow, you muſt put in Tents, twiſt them not too hard, but ſo that the Sanies may
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:115825:199"/> come forth. If the Wound be deep without loſſe of Subſtance, you muſt conſider whether the Orifice of the Wound look upward or downward. If the Orifice look downward, and the bottom be upward, then may the Matter run freely out of the Wound, and the Cure thereof is performed as a ſimple Wound in the Fleſh. But if the Orifice of the Wound be upward, and the bottom tending to the lower parts, that there is a place for the Matter to reſt in, then if you find it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (as many times it is) make an Inciſion, from the top to the bottom, or onely in the bottom; let rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon guide you whereto make your Inciſion or when to neglect it. Waſh the Wound with Wine, wherein Mirrh and Salt hath been boiled: then put in this Oyl, which is much commended, and it is made thus: <hi>Take of Oyl of Olives, three pound: of white Wine, two pound: of the Flowers, Leavs, and Seeds, of St. John's Wort, one pound: of greek Valerian, the ſpotted and common Sanicle, Saracens conſound, amd Self-heal, of each, half a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; beat the Herbs in a Morter, and infuſe them in the Wine and Oyl twenty four hours, then boil it gently to the Conſumption of almost half: then strain it, and add there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, of Venice Turpetine, one pound and an half: Oyl of Turpetine, ſix Ounces: Olibonum, five Ounces: Mirrh three Ounces: Maſtich, and Sanguis Draconis, of each, one Ounce: Roots of Alchenet, (firſt bruiſed and infuſed in Oyl two or three hours,) boil them gently and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and reſerve it for the uſe aforeſaid.</hi> Then lay on Emplaſtrum Sticticum, the receipt of which you may read in <hi>the London Diſpenſatory:</hi> or you may buy the Plaiſter at the Apothecaryes.</p>
               <p>If the Wound be hollow with loſſe of Subſtance, you muſt make uſe of ſuch Medicines which are by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture drying and cleanſing, called Incarnatives.</p>
               <p>This Unguent is much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for cleanſing Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, &amp; breeding of good Fleſh in Wounds.</p>
               <pb n="402" facs="tcp:115825:200"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of common Oyl, and Rams ſuet of each one pound: Stone-pitch, half a pound, Grecian-pitch, three Ounces; wax two Ounces, Mastich, Olibanum, Galbanum, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacum, Sagapenum, Opopanax, and Turpentine of each half an Ounce: powder thoſe that are to be powdered, and melt the reſt in Oyl, ſtirr them well together on the fire; when they are ſufficiently boiled, add the Turpentine, ſtrain it, and uſe it upon occaſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This plaiſter is very good to incarnate both wounds and Ulcers; <hi>Take of Virgins wax eight Ounces, Deers ſuet four ounces and an half; Common Rozin, and Rozin of the Pinetree of each four Ounces; Myrrhe and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, of each four Ounces; Honey ſix ounces; Turpentine eight Ounces, White Wine one pound and an half, Dragons bloud one pound; boil them (the Sanguis Draconis excepted) to the form of a plaiſter.</hi> Or you may make a leſſe quantity by decreaſing each particular analogically. Take this generall Rule, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Dryth or moiſture of the body or wound, you muſt make your medicines leſſe or more drying, when the wound commeth to be plain, equall and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it muſt be Cicatrized, or covered with skin; which muſt be performed by medicines which are aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and very much drying, becauſe it muſt conſume not onely the ſuperfluous, but alſo the naturall moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, of which properly are the ſimples following: Galls, Balauſtines, the rinds of Pomegranats, the white Thiſtle, Sumach, Bolearmenick, Sealed Earth, Ceruſe, Lead burnt or waſhed, Litharge, and the Bark of the Pinetree. To which add the following, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it accidentally, as Braſſe burnt and waſhed, the ſcales of Braſſe; Alume and Vitrioll, burnt and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Plantane, Ariſtolochia, and ſuch like. Of theſe and ſuch like, may many forms of Medicines, <hi>viz.</hi> Waters, Oyls, Unguents, or Plaiſters, be made. Take
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:115825:200"/> this Plaiſter as an example for all. <hi>Take of Litharge, and Ceruſe of each ſix Ounces, burnt lead, Lapis Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaris, and Terra Sigillata, of each three Ounces: Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophonia, Ship-Pitch, and Rozin, of each two Ounces, Sarcocolla, Laudanum, and Ireos, of each one Ounce and an half, Camphir, half an Ounce, Leake ſeed two Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Oyl of Roſes, one pound and an half, white Wax four Ounces; make it into a plaiſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Cicatrice be uncomely or deformed, it muſt be amended: if it be too tender, it muſt be thickned, and hardned with Diachilon, or with Calamint, the roots of Briony and ſuch like ſodden in Oyl. If the Cicatrice be thick and hard, it ought to be attenuated with the root of wild Cucumer, ſtampt and applyed, or the Oyl of Balſome-Apple. If it be deformed in reſpect of colour, you muſt labour to bring it to white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for which this plaiſter is commended; <hi>Take of Swines Greaſe three Ounces, Litharge one Ounce, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digreeſe and burnt Vitrioll, of each two drachms; make it into a plaiſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes a wound is overgrown with fleſh: this fleſh growing too proudly, muſt be dealt withall with medicines that may diminiſh, and take away the ſame, and they muſt be by nature ſharp and drying; as Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citis, Vitriol, burnt Allum, the roots of Aſphodels, Hermodactylls, the ſtones of Dates burnt, the ſeed of Nettles, Serpentary, the Scales of Braſſe, burnt Braſs, the aſhes of a Hedghog, Mercury ſublimnte; Of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines compounded, Unguentum Apoſtolorum, or Unguentum Aegyptiacum are of known validity.

               <p>THat the wound is contuſed appeareth by the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, pain, black or blew colour; whether it were given by a fall, or blow, the patient can ſatisfy you. The Cure conſiſteth, firſt in mundiſying, filling the hollowneſſe, with incarnative Medicines, and when it is made plain and even, cover it with Cicatrizing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. And ſecondly, in removing the accident, which for the moſt part accompanieth a wound of this nature. Firſt, to mundify the wound, waſh it in white Wine, wherein hath bin boiled Myrrhe and Salt, then arm your Tents with Unguentum Apoſtolorum, or ſuch like, and lay on dry ſtapes and bind it up; this do till the wound be clean; then fill it up with incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Medicines, afterwatds Cicatrize it; the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines for that purpoſe in the foregoing Chapter will ſerve here. Secondly, labour to remove the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents incident to theſe wounds, which are either pain or ſwelling. Pairl muſt be mitigated with Oyl of Dill, Chamomil, or Lillies. Or a Liniment made of the Oil of Roſes, and the yolk of an Egg, and applyed with Lint. The ſwelling or Tumor is to be removed by taking away the Antecedent or conjoyned cauſe: the Antecedent cauſe is the humour flowing to the wounded part, the conjoyned cauſe is the humour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready contained in the part. For taking away the antecedent cauſe, you muſt conſider, whether it be bloud or other humours. If it be bloud, whether it comes from the whole body, or ſome particular part, it
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:115825:201"/> muſt be evacuated by bloud-letting, and a thin coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Diet. You muſt evacuate and diſparch it from the wounded member, either by revulſion, or repercuſſion: Revulſion muſt be made either by Phleboromy, Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, Rubbing, and binding the contrary ſide, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the humour to the contrary part. Repercuſſion is to ſend the matter from the part: of this ſort are the Oyl of Roſes, and Myrtles; or an Unguent made of Oyl of Myrtles, Bolearmenick, and the White of an Egg, with which the parts about the Wound are to be anointed: Afterwards lay on a Plaiſter made of the Powder of Myrtles, and the White of an Egg. If it be other Humours, which flow to the Wound, let them be purged with ſuch Medicines as are proper to the Humour: The fore-going Book is full of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and the laſt Book is well furniſhed. The Humor which is now impact in the Wound, muſt be brought to Suppuration: This Plaiſter is good; <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſhmallows, and wild Cucumers, of each half an Ounce: Origan and Hyſop, of each half a handful: the Flowers of Camomel, and the Seed of Flax, of each one pugil: ſix ſat Figs; boit them well, then ſtrain the liquor from them, and beat them in a Morter; add to them Mirrh, Galbanum, Styrax Liquida, and Sheeps Greaſe (ſeparated from the woot which grows in the Flank, and between their ſhoulders,) of each one drachm and an half; make a plaiſter.</hi>

<pb n="406" facs="tcp:115825:202"/> joyned again. For the Cure, in reſpect of the wounded Part, obſerve the ſame rule in taking away pans and ſwelling, either by evacuation, or repercuſſion. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the whole body, you muſt conſider whether there be clotted bloud in the body; which if there be, it muſt be diſſolved and ſcattered by Medicines, which diſſolve bloud, and fireng then the inner parts; and ſecondly, it muſt be ſcattered by Diaphoretick, or Sweating Medicines. This Powder is good to diſſolve bloud; <hi>Take of Rubarb terrified, ſealed Earth, Bolear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick, Mummy, and the ſeed of Creſſes torrified, of each one drachm; make them into fine powder, and give a drachm in Plantane water, or the water of Shepheards pouch.</hi>

               <p>To provoke Sweat, boil a handful or two of Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Royal, and Horſtaile, in Wine, ſweeten the Decection with Honey, give five or ſix Ounces there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and let the Patient ſweat thereupon. If the bloud be clotted under the skin, apply a Rams skin newly pulled off hot to the body, and let the Patient ſweat in it. Then anoint it with this Unguent, &amp;c. <hi>Take of Bolearmenick, Frankincenſe, Rezin, Fenugreck, and Gum Traganth, of each half an ounce; Saffron one drachm, the powder of Roſes, Mirtles, and Sumach, of each three drachms; the Ointment of Maiſh mallows, the Oyl of Roſes, Camomel, Mirtles, and Dill, of each two Ounces: New Wax and Turpentine, of each one Ounce, make an unguent, and uſe it twice a day.</hi> After you have uſed this Omtment a while, leave out the Ingredients, which are aſtringent, and uſe diſcutients onely. If you find the matter will not be diſcuſſed, but is prone to Suppuration, help it forward by ſuch Medicines as are proper for the purpoſe: then procure Iſſue, and mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie the Ulcer, and heal it up.</p>

               <p>VVHat Creature inflicted the Wound, moſt people know, or whether he be venemous or not: Venemous are, a Mad-Dog, Serpent, Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, Baſilisk, Dragon, Viper, Adder, Slow-Worm, Aſp, Spider, Toad, &amp;c. Not venemous, are a Dog, Ape, Horſe, Sow, Cat, Waſp, Bee, and the like. If the Creature were venemous, the Symptomes are more violent, <hi>viz.</hi> vehement pricking, and biting pains, change of colour, and grievous anguiſhes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the body is aſtoniſhed, ſometimes in a great heat, and the like.</p>
               <p>A venemous biting is very danperous, if it be not ſoon cured; becauſe Poyſon ayms at the deſtruction of the Heart. Some ſay if the Patient be thirſty, and yet is fearful of Drink, he is incurable: This I once ſaw verified in a Boy that was bit by a Mad. Dog. If the Patient be bit by a venemous Creature, the Cure may be begun with cupping the wounded part, with ſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieation, to draw forth the Venome: ſucking of the Wound is commended, inſtead thereof, apply the tail of an Hen: if the part be not full of ſinews, apply a Cautery; and if the venome be very malignable, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is commended. External Medicines muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:115825:203"/> to draw the Venome back: Of this ſort are the Simples following, Garlick, Onyons, Muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, Harts-eaſe, Scabius, Peneroyal, Calamint, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Polymountain, Germander, Scordium, Ditany, Briony, Aſphodels, Ariſtolochia, Euphorbium, Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Treacle, Leaven, Goats Dung, &amp;c.

This Plaiſter is good: <hi>Take of the Powder of Long Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort two ounces, Aſphodels and Briony, of each one ounce, Aſſa Foetida; Galbanum and Mirrh, of each half an Ounce, with Oyl of Bays and Wax; make a Plaister.</hi> This following Unguent is commended by <hi>Veſalius, Take of Galbanum, and Opoponax, of each one drachm, Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacum, Turpentine, and Wax, of each one drachm and an half; Sagapenum two drachms, Pitch two drachms and an half: put them over a gentle fire, and when they boyl a little, put in a ſmall quantity of Bean-flower, Leth argie, Saffron, and Bdellium, of each one drachm; Mirrh, and Olibanum, of each half a drachm; Maſtich, four ſcruples, Fenugreek one ſcruple, boil them as much as you find con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient; then with the Oyl of Roſes, and Seaſamini, of each two drachms, make an Unguent.</hi>

               <p>If a Sinew be burnt, there is great pain, hurt both of ſenſe and motion, ſometimes a Feaver, Inflammation, Convulſion, or raving; a breach or wound of a Vein, or Artery, is known by profuſion of bloud. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Vein or Arterie be wounded, their proper figns muſt diſtinguiſh, <hi>viz.</hi> the bloud black and thick, with an equal fluxion, ſheweth a wounded Vein: but if the bloud be thin and yellow, and cometh forth leaping, like the motion of the Pulſe, then is the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wounden.</p>
               <p>The Nervous Ligaments will endure Medicines of great force: If in Wounds of this nature a Tumor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and afterwards vaniſh away it threatneth danger of Convulſion and Raving. If a Nerve be wounded overthewart, and not cut alunder, it brings the move peril of Convulſion. An Artery cut overthwart is ſooner joyned together, then if it were ſevered long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. An Artery cut is harder to cure then a Vein. Flux of bloud is peril lous, eſpecially of an Artery; for unleſs it be ſtopped, it bringeth death unavoidably. Swooning, Convulſion, Raving, &amp;c. in this caſe, is an evil token. For the Cure, if the Nerve be priekt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin thus: If there be any weapon, or any outward thing ſticking in the Wound, let it be removed, and keep the part from in jury, &amp; if you fear inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, open a Vein. Let him lye in a warm Room, on a ſoft bed; and keep the body looſe, by Cliſters, or laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Medicines, regulated according to the nature of the humour peccant. Let his Diet be ſparing, and ſmall Beer his Drink. Let him lye as free from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as may be; let not the cold Air, which is inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to the Sinews, afflict him; not too hot Air, for fear of inflammation. Keep the Wound oren, &amp; if it be not wide enough, makeit wider: then uſe ſuch Medicines,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:115825:204"/> that may eaſe the pain, and draw forth the eruginous and fretting matter: Medicines which heat and dry without pain, is good in this caſe; as the Oyl of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petine, Ireos, Sage, Elder; or Water, wherein Salt and Turpetine hath been boyled; the Oyl of Earth-Worms, and of the yolks of Eggs mixed; or the Oyl of Roſes and Turpetine; or the Oyl of Turpetine, and of Savine mixed; or Euphorbium one drachm, boiled in two Ounces of Oyl. For which purpoſe, this Plaiſter is good: <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſhmallows, the Meal of Barley, Beans, and Lentils, of eaeh a like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, as much as you think good: boil them in Lye; then put to it Oyl of Roſes, Camomel, Dill, and Turpetine, of each ſufficient, and a little Saffron, ſo make a Plaiſter.</hi> If the Wound will come to ſuppuration, heal it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and afterwards mundify it.</p>
               <p>If the Nerve be cut, after you have obſerved the aſorelaid general Rules, joyn the Nerve; then apply this Medicine: <hi>Take of Karth-worms prepared three drachms Horstail two drachms, Betony and Nettles in powder, of each one drachm; Olibanum three drachms: encorporate them with the ſleſh of Snails beaten, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it four days,</hi> laying on ſome Glutinative Unguent. <hi>Take of the leſſer Century, Plantane, Hounds-tongue, Mouſe. ear, both the Conſonds, Horſe tail, and Yarrow, of each one handſal; Earth-worms a pound and an half; Oyl and Wine, of each one pound and an half; Vinegar ſour ounces: stamp them, and let them infuſe 7 dayes: then add the Suet of a Ram one peund, Pitch and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin, of each ſour ounces: boil them to the conſumption of the Wine and Vinegar; add to the straining Ammonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, Gathanum, Opaponax, diſſolved in Vinegar, of each 5 drachms: Turpemine one ounce and an half, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, Maſlick, and Sarcocol, of each three drachms: Of

               </p>
               <p>If the Vein or Artery be cut, you muſt firſt labour to ſtanch the bloud: Secondly, to cure the Wound. Firſt, the bloud may be ſtanched, either with, or withs out Evacuation: With Evacuation, is to open a Vein on the contrary part, and ſometimes near the Wound, and to let it fly, and ſuddainly ſtop it again. To ſtay the bloud without Evacuation, muſt be performed by cupping, with ſcarrifying, binding and rubbing of the contrary part. Secondly, you muſt bridle the furious courſe of in by things that thicken, cool, and aſtoniſh: Things which thicken the bloud, are Rice, Lentils, Jujubees. Quinces, and all Stiptick Fruits. Cold Water drunk, or laid upon the member near the Wound, doth aſtoniſh it. It the Vein or Artery lye ſo that you may eaſily come at it, ty the end with fine ſilk, ſtitch up the Wound, and apply aſtrictive Powders upon it; and upon that lay on the like powder, mixed with the White of an Egg, with Stuphs. This Powder is good: <hi>Frankincenſe, Aloes, Terra Sigillata, Bolearmenick, and Senguis Draconis, of each equal parts; pouder them fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with the white of an Egg, and the hairs of a Hare, let it be applyed:</hi> Or this, <hi>Take of Lapis Haemitatis one ounce; Frankincenſe, Maſtich, Bolearmenick, Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs green Galls, dried Frogs, Soot, white wall, and the Meal that lye upon the walls of Mills and Bake-houſes, of each two drachms: Burnt Vitriol, Quick-lime, and Gum-Traganth, of each three drachms; the ſhaving of the skin of a Ram, or He-Goat, Paper-cards, the hairs of an Hare, and cotton torrified, of each one drachm: Aſſes dung half an ounce; make it into fine powder, and uſe it as the fermer.</hi> The accidental Symptomes both of this and

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of Luxations and Fractures.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A Luxation, or Diſlocation, is the ſlipping of a joint from his Natural Poſition, and proper place, into ſome ſtrange and unwonted ſeat, whereby voluntary motion is hindered. A Fracture is a diviſion or brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the bone: the cauſes of the firſt are either outward or inward; outward cauſes are falls, ſtrokes, extenſion, wrenching, or the like, the Patient is able to inform you. The inward cauſes are filthy, ſlimy, and Phlegmatick Humours, falling between the joynt, as it many times happeneth in the Sciatica. Cauſes of Fractures, are things of weight falling upon the place, or the Patient falls from on high, ſlippeth, or ſuch like.</p>
               <p>A Diſlocation is known by theſe ſigns, <hi>viz.</hi> a Tumor in the part where the bone lies, a pit or cavity in the place from whence the bone is departed, great pain, a difficulty or deprivation of motion in that member. The bone broken is eaſily ſeen; but whether the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture be overthwart, or long ways, you may diſcern thus: If it be overthwart, by ſeeling you may diſcern the bone ſeveral, and disjoyned, the bones make a noiſe and crackling, when you handle each ſide di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly. If it be long-ways, the former ſigns appear not and that part appeareth thicker then ordinary, uneven, and painful.</p>
               <pb n="414" facs="tcp:115825:206"/>
               <p>Of bones that ſlip out of their places, ſome are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repoſed, and ſome more hardly; the knee eaſily ſlippeth out, and is eaſily put in again, the fingers and ſhoulders may eaſily be reduced. The jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, the ſhoulder-blade, <hi>Ostali,</hi> the heel-bone, the hand and middle of the foot do commonly knit in fourteen or one and twenty dayes: the hip in fifty dayes, and the foot in ſixty, if the Patient give it reſt. If in the ſetting the bone crack, or make a noiſe, and the member look like the other, it will be well, the Elbow ſeldom ſlippeth out, and is not put in againe without much trouble. If the borders of the bones are broken, it is the worſe. If a wound, Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a violent paine accompany the Luxation, it is dangerous and hard to be cured. If it hath continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long, and is grown Callous, it is hard to be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If a Child happen to have a diſlocation, and it be not reduced, the member groweth little or nothing.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe in a fracture the bones of the Armes, Leggs, Thighs and Fingers are not very dangerous, the farther from the head the better. A fracture accompanied with violent pain, Inflammation, wound in the fleſh, or contuſion, is very bad, becauſe it cannot be dealt withall, till thoſe accidents be firſt removed. In declining age, and Cholerick perſons the cure is difficult; in very aged perſons impoſſible, the older the Patient is, the worſe, a rib broken is dangerous. The breach of the bone or Griſtle of the noſe is bad, worſe if the fleſh be wounded. In a fracture of the ſcul theſe are dangerous ſymptomes; when the membrane is unmoveable, black or evil-coloured: loſs of wits, reſolution or diſtenſion of the Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ves. A Tranſverſe fracture is moſt tolerable: a ſlope fracture
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:115825:206"/> with looſe fragments is worſe, but if it be ſharp pointed, it is worſt of all. The ſcull asketh thirty dayes to be joyned: the Arme and Leggs fourty dayes, the Cubit thirty, a rib one and twenty, the Showlder and Thigh fourty, the bone of the noſe is joyned in eight or ten dayes.</p>
               <p>For the cure, firſt of a diſlocation, the bone muſt be ſtretched out, and compelled to its proper place. But the operation muſt be warily and variouſly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, according to the nature of the part, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſcituation, and knitting of the bones, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, and Nerves. Sometimes it may be done by the hand, and ſometimes not without hands and Engines: when it is in, you muſt labour to keep it ſo, by ſtrengthening the member, anoint it with the oyle of Roſes, Myrtles, and Maſtich, then lay on a linnen Cloath dipped firſt in oyle of Roſes, upon that Cloths wet in the white of an Egg, and put upon it ſome aſtringent Powders: then rowle it up with Clothes wet in Water and Vinegar, then ſplent it with ſtiffe Leather or Paſtboard, bind it not too hard for feare of inflammation, then leave it ſo ſeaven or ten dayes, unleſſe any ſymptome ariſe. Then open it and bathe it with warme water, to diſcuſſe the ſuperfluities and eaſe pain, and do it up as before, and bind it a little harder. If there be inflammation, wound, or fracture with the diſlocation it is dangerous, and many times the placeing of the bone muſt be deferred till the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation be eaſed; if it be with a wound or fracture, the following diſcourſe of the cure of fractures will inſtruct you. If any Callous bardneſſe be gathered between the Luxated bones, the place muſt be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the decoction of Marſh and common-Mallowes; or afterwards it muſt be anointed with the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:115825:207"/> unguent of Marſh Mallowes, and lay on a Payſter of Diachilon Magnum.</p>
               <p>A fracture muſt be thus dealt with, <hi>viz.</hi> let the Patient ſit or lye in a place convenient, or ſuch as the nature of the member requireth, let two with their hands, one under the member, and the other above, or one to the left hand, the other to the right joyne the broken bone: if you have need of more force, prepare large Tyalls of Linnen, and let two draw one one way, and the other another, and pull the member as much as is needfull; but beware of violent pulling and extenſion of the member, leaſt vehement pain, Fevers, Convulſions, and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be procured: when the bone is in its place and joyned, labour to keep it ſo, and bind it up as is taught before in binding up of a diſlocation, and lay it beſt for the Patients caſe: open it not in fifteen dayes, unleſſe pain, Inflammation, Itching, or ſome ſuch like ſymptome; in the mean while foment the member round about it with the Oyle of Roſes, Myrtels and Maſtick. After fifteen dayes open it again, and foment it with Wine, wherein Worm-wood, Roſes, and a little Salt hath been boyled, and bind it up as before, till ſeven dayes be paſt, then open it againe, and apply <hi>Emplaſtrum Oxycroceum</hi> upon it. If the fracture be in the lower parts, move not the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Cliſter or otherwiſe, if the body be full of blood open a vein, becauſe it hinders defluxions. In the beginning let his diet be but ſlender, after the tenth day let him eat freely of ſuch things as ingender thick, and cleaving juyces, as Rice, Wheat, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes of Sheep, and the feet of Calves, and Sheep, and ſuch like.</p>
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:115825:207"/>
               <p>If there be a contuſion with the fracture, you muſt not roule up the member as before you are taught, but ſlopewiſe on either ſide of the contuſion, that ſo you may come to dreſſe the contuſion, and not open tho member, the like you may do if there be a wound; but if there be any ſmall ſplints that prick the member, they muſt be taken out before. If you find that the Callus grow not faſt enough, apply ſuch things as draw nouriſhment to the place: as warm-water, moderate frications, and a Plaiſter of Pitch. If it grow over great, apply that which may diminiſh i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oment the part with warm-water, and Oyl of Roſes, and ſuch things which are appropriated to allay ſuch diſtempers: and apply no ſplents till the inflammation be removed. If the part be vexed with Itch, or Puſtules, anoint it with <hi>unguentum populeon, diapompholigos</hi> or <hi>album.</hi> If the part gangrene, ſcarrifie it, and deale with it, as you ſhall be taught in its proper place.</p>

               </head>
               <p>FIrſt Phlegmon is a Tumor begotten of pure blood, and is for the moſt part incident to the fleſhy parts; the Antecedent cauſe is abundance of blood. In which Tumor are three things conſiderable, firſt the part that ſendeth it, either by reaſon of its plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſtrength, or ſtreightneſſe of paſſages; Secondly, the part receiving it, either by reaſon of weakneſſe, largeneſſe or opening of the paſſages, or by the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of its ſcituation. Thirdly, the part drawing it, which it doth either through heat or pain within it. The conjoyned cauſe is much blood in the part, which before it cometh to ſuppuration, cauſeth a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, Redneſſe, heat, and pain: but when it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purate, the Tumor is ſoft, yielding and growing to a point, a pricking and beating pain: laſt of all the skin breaketh, and the <hi>pus</hi> iſſueth out: ſomtimes if the humors be thin, and the skin of the ſame nature, the Tumor may be reſolved without ſuppuration.</p>
               <p>To this Tumor happeneth evill accidents ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, if the Chirurgion want care or skill. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it turneth to corruption, and is ſeen by its lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den black colour, and ſtinking ſavor. Somtimes the matter maketh a regreſſion, and the Tumor dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth, but the whole body is inflamed with a Feaver and ſuch like accidents. And ſomtimes it turneth into a Schirrhous hardneſſe.</p>
               <p>In the cure the Antecedent cauſe muſt be firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. Therefore firſt let the Chirurgion open the Liver-vein, or any other vein, which he finds hath
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:115825:210"/> more affinity with the ſending part; if he ſee good, he may bleed him in the oppoſite part for a revulſion, and derive the matter to ſome part adjacent, by cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, frication, or Ligatures; and apply to the part affected medicines that cool and repell or beat back the flowing humors; and of this ſort are theſe ſimples. Acatia, Vinegar, Balauſtines, Bolearme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, Camphite, ſealed Earth, Myrtles, Pome-granate Peels, unripe Grapes, Vine-leaves, the leaves of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus, Plantane, Oake, Sumach, Night-ſhade, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, Houſleeke, Lettuce, Purſlane, Roſes, and ſuch like. Of theſe you may make ſomentations, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſmes, to be uſed in the beginning of the Tumor, to hinder and beat back the blood, which floweth to feed it. Take this caution that in ſome caſes, theſe medicines ought not to be medled with, to wit when the humor is Malignant, or thick; or if the Tumor be Criticall: Or upon ſome of the Glandulous parts.</p>
               <p>Next you muſt deale with the conjoyned cauſe, or the blood impact in the part affected. If you judgo that the blood is thin, and apt to be diſcuſſed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing medicines are to be applyed. This Cataplaſm is good: <hi>Take the leaves of Mallows, Melilot and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momell, of each one handfull: the ſeeds of Dill, Flax, and Fenugreek, of each half an ounce, boyle them to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Water, then beat them in a Stone-Morter; and add to it the oyle of Dill, and Camomell, of each one ounce: a little Honey and Leaven, and make it into the form of a Cataplaſm.</hi> But if the matter be thick, and not fit to be diſcuſſed, then labour to bring it to ſuppuration. For which theſe Simples are proper, Warm water, Butter, Wheaten Bran, or Wheaten bread, the greaſe of an Hogg, Calfe, Gooſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Greaſe

If the hot intemperature doth ſtirr up a Fever, let the diet be ordered, and ſuch medicines adminiſtred, as the nature of the Fever requireth; ſee the ſecond book, among the Chapters of Feavers; when you find it very ſoft, and well ſuppurated, open it with a Lancet, where it is ſofteſt, and in the moſt convenient place for the matter to come forth; afterwards mundifie, incarnate and Cicatize it.</p>
               <p>A Carbuncle is a Sanguine Tumor, the antecedent cauſe of it is black, thick, hot and faculent blood, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the place: the conjoyned cauſe is the ſettling of the blood in the part as you have heard before. The ſignes of a Carbuncle are ſometimes but one, and ſomtimes many ſmall puſtu'es like burnt bliſters, which being broken, a cruſty Ulcer enſueth. If it be peſtilentiall, the cruſt is black or Aſh colour, about it redneſſe, Inflammation and grevious pain; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is troubled with Loathing, Vomiting, loſſe of Appetite, Palpitation of the heart, and Swoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Carbuncles for the moſt part are attendants of the Plague, and Epidemicall cauſes. If they come upon the Emunctuories, there is very great danger, leſt the venemons humors fall upon ſome principall part. If it break out about the Stomach, or Jaws, there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Choaking. If the colour be firſt Red, after Yellowiſh, it is laudable, but if it be black or blew it is dangerous; If the accidents which accompany the diſeaſe vaniſh, there is hepes.</p>

               <p>In the cure, firſt have regard to the antient cauſe which is thick hot blood, and muſt be altered and evacuated, to alter the quality of the blood, give him broath of Chickens, with Lettice, Purſlane, Pomegranates, and Lemons; and his drink Barly-Water: give him medicines cooling and concocting: as Juleps made of ſyrup of Vinegar, Pomegranates, Citrons, Lemons and Endive; and the diſtilled water of Lettice, Purſlane, and the like. But if the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence be preſent, you muſt have reſpect to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, and give ſuch medicines which ſtrengthen the Heart and Vitalls: <hi>See the</hi> 90. <hi>Chapter of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book;</hi> the quantity muſt be diminiſhed, ether by blood-letting, cupping, or medicines, as gentle Purges or Cliſters; in all which be well adviſed, if the Plague be preſent. If there be a great fluxion of blood to the part, lay on diſcutients and repreſſings: diſcutients you have before. Take this caution that you apply gentle ones in the beginning, and ſtronger when the matter is gathered, to lay defenſives to the adjacent parts, as the Oyntment of Roſes, Bolearme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, or the oyle of Mittles and Vinegar; alſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractives are convenient, as hot Bread, the warm Lungs of beaſts new killed, the taile of a Cock made bare, and a little Salt put into it and applyed, or young Pidgeons ſlit alive and applyed warm. The cauſe conjoyned muſt be taken away by Chirurgions, or Medicine: firſt ſcatifying of the Tumor (if nothing (orbid it) deeply, and waſh it with warm-water Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeches are good. When the matter cannot be diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or otherwiſ delt with, you muſt apply ſuch things as have an altering, or ripening quality, as is aforeſaid.

               <p>FIrſt, <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> or <hi>ignis Sacer,</hi> is a Cholerick Fluxion, chiefly conſiſting betwixt, or about the skins. The antecedent cauſe is Choller, abounding and flowing to the part. The conjoyned cauſe is the ſame Humour there ſetled. The firſt is known by a Cholerick Conſtitution and Diet. The ſecond is known by great heat, ſmall Tumour, reddiſh or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low colour, ſoon vaniſhing in touching, and quickly returning: The pain is not with pulſation and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but biting and pricking, and the Patient is ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the motion of a Tertian Feaver. <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> about the head is a hard thing to cure, and it eaſily gets into the Face, and there ſpreadeth: for the fleſh there is thin, and the humour light and active. If it happen to the Womb of a woman with child, it is deadly: if it lye near the bone, it is dangerous: if it return from the outward parts to the inward, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evil: the like judge, if it come to ſuppuration, which it ſeldom doth, but is ſent forth by tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, order the Air to be cool and moiſt, where your Patient lodgeth, and his Diet of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Bleed not, unleſs bloud be mixed with Choller, which is called <hi>Eryſipelas Phlegmonoſum:</hi> Then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Humours with Tuleps convenient, made of the Syrups of Vinegar Simple, Bugloſs, Maiden-hair,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:115825:214"/> Violets, Water-Lillies, Endive, and Succory, and their diſtilled Waters, or others of the like nature. When you have prepared the humour, purge it either by Cliſter, or Potion. This Potion is much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: <hi>Take of the beſt Rubarb four ſeruples, the Flowers of Violets and Borrage, of each one drachm, the decoction of Tamarinds, ſufficient: inſuſe the Flowers and Rbubarb ten hours, ſtrain them, and diſſolve therein Diacatholicon three drachms, Syrrup of Roſes two ounces, and make a Potion. Veſalius.</hi> You may alter, or make variety of Potions, as you ſee occaſion: Or empty your body with this Cliſter; <hi>Take Marſh and common Mallows, Violet leaves, Camomel, and Lettice, of each one handful; the ſeeds of Aniſe, Fennel, and the four great cold ſeeds, of each one drachm; the flowers of Borage, Bugleſs, Violets, and Water-Lillies, of each one Pugil; Polypodium, and Senna, of each one ounce: make a Decoction to a pint; of which add of Caſſia one ounce; Diacatholicon, half an ounce, Oyl of Violets, two ounces, make a Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Add ſtrength and aid to the part, by cooling and repelling Medicines, <hi>viz.</hi> Epithems, and Liniments, made of the juyce or diſtilled Water of Night-ſhade, Houſleek, Stonecrop, Fleabane, and Henbane, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flane, Lettice, Endive, Succory, and ſuch like; the Oyl of Roſes, and Water-Lillies, Vinegar, Sanders, the White of Eggs, the Muſilage of Quince ſeeds, &amp;c. Compounds are the Unguent of Roſes, or <hi>Refrigerans Galeni,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>The conjoyned cauſe muſt be removed by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which have power to evacuate and diſcuſs; <hi>Take of the Litharge of Gold one ounce, waſhed Ceruſe ſix drachms, the juyce of Plantane, and Womans milk, of each

               <p>There are other Yumonis, which do commonly aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate with <hi>Eryſipelas, viz.

               <p>The cure of theſe, differ little from the former; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the ſame Dier and Medicines, externally and internally, making this difference: In the firſt, let the Medicines preparing be more cutting, and the purging Medicines ſtronger, becauſe of the thickneſs of the Humour; and let the outward Medicines be more powerfully diſcutient. In the cure of <hi>Herpes Miliaris,</hi> obſerve the ſame Diet, to your Preparatives, and ſuch things as cut Phlegm: To your Purges, ſuch as purge Phlegme. Extemal Medicines may by an eaſie Brain be regulated, little differing from the former. This Cataplaſm is very good: <hi>Take of Pidgcons Dung freſh, as much as you pleaſe: mix it with Wheaten flower, and apply it cold, and cover it with a Colewort Leafe; renew it twice in</hi> 24 <hi>hours.</hi>

               <p>This Diſeaſe is more prone to Reſolution, than Suppuration: ſometimes it turneth to Nodes and Knots in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Order your Patient with a Diet, contrary in quality to the Diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Heating, drying, and making thin. Then prepare the Humour for Evacuation; theſe Simples are good: Betony, Sage, Hyſop, Balm, Polymountain, Penyroyal, Calamint, Origanum, Margarom, Southernwood, Mint, Wormwood, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, Groundpine, Cowſlips, Agrimony, Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hair, the cold Seeds, Lignum Vitae, the Roots of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus, Acorus, Ireos, Galanga, Elicampane, Smallage, Parſley, Graſs, Aſparagus, Butchers Broom, Fenel, &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>When the Humoes are thus prepared, you muſt come to purging them with ſuch Medicines, as purge the Phlegmatick Humours: the next Book will furniſh you with ſtore of ſuch Medicines, ſo that I need nor here inſert them. Outwardly ſortifie the part with this or the like Unguent. Take of Bolearmenick, and Acatia, of each one ounce, Cyperus half an ounce, Aloes and Myrrh, of each five drachms, Saffron half a drachm, the juyce of Coleworts two ounces, Oyl of Roſes four ounces, Vinegar one drachm and an half; Wax ſufficient, to make an Unguent. Concerning the matter impact in the parts, you muſt conſider whether it be thin, and may be reſolved; or thick and ſubject to ſuppuration,</p>
               <p>If the Humor be thin, lay on this, or a Plaiſter of this nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of Cow Dung one pound and an half, Olibanum, Styrax, Moſs of Trees, Calamus, Atomaticus, Spicknard, Wormwood, of each half an ounce; make them up with Vinegar, and the decoction of Coleworts into the ſorm of a plaister.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>If you fear that the Humours may ſuffer in the mean while, provide internal and external Medicines for the ſame: <hi>Take of Conſerve of the Flowers of Stechas, and Roſemary, of each one ounce; of the Rinds of Citrons preſerved half an ounce, Emblicks, and Mirabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans preſerved two drachms, Species Diacinnamon two ſcruples with Syrup of Citron Peels, make an Electuary; whereof let the Patient take the quantity of a Nut an hour before meat,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſthume being ripe, open it with an hot Iron, or Couſtick; then mundifie it with <hi>Unguentum Apostolorum,</hi> or cleanſe it with this following Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent: <hi>Take of Galbanum, Ammoniacum, Rozin, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petine, Pitch, Bullocks Tallow, and Oyl, of each a like quantity: Diſſolve the Gums in Vinegar, and then let them hoil a little with the reſt upon the fire. Afterwards incarnate and cicatrize it as you do other Ulcers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of this Phlegmatick Humour is ſometimes ingendred a flatuous and windy Tumor, which is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered either under the skin, or under the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, which cover and cloath the Bones and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
               <p>They appear with a certain brightneſs and ſhining, reſiſt the touch; and being ſmitten, ſound like a Bladder: the pain is extenſive, and ſtretching. Let his Drink be ſuch, as expels and prevents ſuch Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. Let the Humours be prepared by Wine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling Julips, and the Body emptied by Carminative, and Cliſters, and convenient Purges.</p>
               <p>Then you muſt attenuate, diſcuſs, and ſcatter the conjoyned Cauſe; theſe Simples are fit for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Aniſe, Fenol, Dill, Caraway, Carots, Commin,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:115825:216"/> Siler Montauum, Smallage, Parſley, Rue, Bay-Berries, Oyl of Rue, Bays, Flowerdeluce, Nard, Spike, Nuts, Euphorbium, and ſuch like. Of theſe, and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of the like nature, are many Unguents and Plaiſters formed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of the Oyl of Camomel, Dill, Bitter Almonds, and Rue, of each one ounce; the Seed of Anniſe, Fenel, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots, Caraway, Arreos, and Rue, of each half an ounce: White-wine three ounces: Boil it to the conſumption of the White-wine; ſtrain it, and add Wax ſufficent to make an Unguent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The expert Chirurgeon ought to compound and alter his Unguents, Plaiſters, and all his Medicines, according to the conſtitution of the Patient, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Tumor; for which it is impoſſible to lay down certain Rules. Give inwardly Diacinnamom, Diacalamenthum, Aromaticum, Roſatum, Diagalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, Dianiſum, and ſuch like; and lay a Plaiſter of the ſame nature to the ſtomach. If a Watry Tumor is ingendred in any part, or all over the body, ſee the 58th Chap. of the 2d Book.</p>
               <p>Struma is a Tumor, in which, underneath, certain Glandules made of Matter and Bloud, and incloſed with a Membrane do grow: They have their place for the moſt part about the Neck, Arm-holes, and ſometimes in other places.

               <p>For the Cure of the Struma, or Kings evill appoint a diet, that will heat, dry, and attenuate; then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the humors. <hi>Take of Oxymell compounded, ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Staechas, honey of Roſes, of each half an ounce: the distiled water of Scabius and fumitory, of each one ounce: mix it for one doſe,</hi> and take thereof as often as need requireth. Then purge with Diaphaenicon, Diacatholicon, Indi majoris, Hiera piera, Pill Cochiae, de agarico, and ſuch like. It is good alſo to cleanſe the blood by Urine: <hi>Take of Pilewort three handfull, Philipendula two handfulls, pimpernell, Mouſeare, Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Red Coleworts, Madder, of each one headfull: the Roots of Fennell, Parſly, round Birthwort, Raddiſh, and ſtinking Gladwin, of each half a handful, the ſeed of Nettles, Juniper, and Bay-berryes, of each one drachm; boyle them in Wite-Wine to the Conſumpoion of half, ſweeten it with Honey, give every ſecond or third day three ounces in the morning.</hi> If the conjoyned cauſe be fit to be reſolved, then uſe meanes that can molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, attenuate, diſperſe and ſepetate: ſuch as is Diachy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Commune, and Magnum, Diapalma, many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents, Liniments, and Plaiſters may be made for the purpoſe aforeſaid, which I heare omit. If the matter be unfit for reſolution, then have you two wayes to empty it, that is ſuppuration, and inciſion. This plaiſter is good to ripen it. <hi>Take the roots of Marſh-Mallows, and Lillyes, of each one pound, boyle them ſoft, and beat them in a Morter: Garlick and Onyons boyled, of each three ounces, the oyle of Lillyes and Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of each two ounces, Hogs greaſe, and Gooſe greaſe, of each two ounces and an half, the Meale of Wheat, Fenugreek and Flax ſeed, ſufficient, the Yolks of two Eggs make a plaister,</hi> when it is ripe open it with an inſtrument, or ruptory of Chantharides or Arſnick.
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:115825:217"/> If it appeare filthy, cleanſe it with Unguentum Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum, Egyptiacum, or ſuch like, afterwards incarnate and Cicatrize it. If it ſubmit not to medicines, it muſt be taken out by manuall operation, which only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to an expert and able Chirurgion: ſeeing the whole cure is difficult, and ought to be managed by an able brain, and skillfull hand, I omitt any further diſcourſe of it, it being my taske principally to inſtruct people of mean Capacity.</p>
               <p>There are three other phlegmatick Tumors, which lye under the generall notion: the firſt is called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theroma,</hi> and is a Tumor without pain and change of colour, which is a humor contained in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braines or Nervous Coats: it is clammy like ſodden Meale, Starch, and ſomtimes mixed (as it were) with haires, peeces of bones, &amp;c. <hi>Meliſeras</hi> is a Tumor ſomwhat thinner, and almoſt of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Hony, otherwiſe agreeing with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. <hi>Steatoma</hi> is much like the two former, ſave that the humor contained is like ſuet, and the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor doth encreaſe, and is much enlarged in proceſſe of time; the inward cauſes of them all are Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick humors, with which the body doth abound. The firſt is thus known, the Tumor is long and ridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; being preſſed, returneth to its place again but ſlowly, by reaſon of the clammyneſſe of the humor; the ſecond Tumor is rounder and thinner, being preſſed, yieldeth and returneth ſpeedily; the laſt is hard, yieldeth not to the preſſing of the finger, for the humor is like Suet.</p>
               <p>The firſt muſt be dealt with by corroſives and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; the ſecond by diſcutients, corroſives, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion;
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:115825:218"/> the laſt no otherwiſe but by inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alone.</p>
               <p>The diet, preparatives, and purges, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for <hi>Oedema,</hi> are here to be uſed. If you find the Tumor fit for reſolution, apply diſcuſſive plaiſters, a plaiſter made of Cyclamen is much commended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of Cyclamen, otherwiſe called Sowbread, as much as you pleaſs, Hogs-greaſe and Brimſtone of each equall parts, beat them into the form of a plaiſter.</hi> If it will not be reſolved, conſume it with eating medicines: among many of this nature, this following is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of the Scales or flower of Braſſe half an ounce, of red Arſenick, and black Ellebore, of each two drachms, with Oyle of Roſes; make a plaiſter;</hi> make a deep eſchar, and make inciſion through it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Cauſtick.</p>
               <p>The Cure may be performed only by inciſion, but the Chirurgion muſt beware that the Tunicle, which holdeth the matter be not broken, leſt ſome part of the humor be left, to the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his operation.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe true and Legitimate Scirrhus is a Tumor hard, without pain, yet ſenſible. The antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent cauſe is Melancholy, abounding in the body; the conjoyned cauſe is the humor fixed in the part. The firſt is known by the Melancholly conſtitution of the Patient; a diet and courſe of life, which is apt to breed Melancholly. The ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> the conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cauſe is known by a Tumor hard and ſcarce yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the touch, in colour between red and black, of dull ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe Tumors if they be timely and carefully dealt with, may be cured by reſolution: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they become indurate, and ſomtimes they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into a Cancer.</p>
               <p>Let the Patient live in a Temperate aire, let him uſe moderate exerciſe, and avoid exceſſive affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and paſſions of the mind, let his body be kept ſoluble, and let his meat be ſuch as is of good nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and eaſie digeſture, and let him therein be moderate.</p>
               <p>Let the Melancholly humors be prepared by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps made of the ſyrups of Fumitory, Borrage, Bugloſe
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:115825:219"/> Endive, Succory, Rubarb, Harts-tongue, Epithymum, and Vinegar, with their diſtilled waters. This A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pozem is very effectuall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take the root and leaves of Sorrell, Borrage, Bugloſſe, and Fumitory, the leaves of Maidenhaire, Succory, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dive, Dandelion, and Hops, of each one handfull; Balm, half a handfull, the four great cold ſeeds beaten, of each two drachms, the ſeed of Purſlane two drachm; Aniſe and Fenell, of each one drachm, Raiſons of the Sun stoned ſix drachms, Polypody, one ounce; Senna one ounce and an half; Time and Epithymum, of each two drachms; the Flowers of Violets, Borrage, and Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſe, of each one pugill, make a decoction, in two pound of which diſſolve the juice of Odoriferous Apples, and of Bugloſſe, of each four ounces, boyle it againe to a pint and an half, then ſweeten it with Sugar, as much as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient: Clarifie it, then Aromatize it with the Powder, Diamargariton Frigidum, and Diatr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>The humor prepared, purge it with ſuch things as purge Melancholly; theſe ſimples are proper; Sena, Polypodium, Epithemum, Fumitory, Caſſia, Lapis Lazuli, and Mitabolans, black Hellebore, and ſuch like. Look for compound Melancholly Purgers in the next book.</p>
               <p>The conjoyned humor muſt be dealt with by ſuch things as ſoften, ſeperate, and diſcuſſe, as the greaſe tryed out of flank Wooll, Butter, the oyle of Almonds, Camomel, Dill, Lillyes, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> the fat of a Cock, a Duck, Gooſe, Fox, Bear, Lyon, Sow, Calfe, Stag, Eagle, Vulture, Bee-Glew, Wax, fat Figgs, Marſh and Common Mallows, Lillyes, Branck urſine.

This plaiſter of <hi>Calmeteus</hi> is of great virtue. <hi>Take of fat Figgs, in Number twelve, boyle and stamp them, Ammoniacum, Bdellium, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banum, diſſolved in Vinegar, of each two ounces, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Styran, one ounce, the Muſilage of Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

By reaſon of the thickneſſe and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe of the humor, it is ſeldom cured, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turneth to an Ulcerate Cancer. Thoſe Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers only that are upon the extreame parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy receive curation: but if they are deeply lodged, they admitt not of cure: a Cancer that is confirmed cannot be cured unleſſe it be rooted up, by inciſion or burning,</p>
               <p>Order your Patient, as before in reſpect of diet, and prepare and purge the Melancholly humor as before is taught: in this caſe let purges be very gentle and often reiterated.

               </head>
               <p>An Ulcer is a ſolution of continuity in the fleſh, containing Sanies and Pus. The antecedent cauſes is Bloud, Choler, Flegm, Melancholy thereto flowing, as hath been ſaid of Tumors; the joyned cauſe is diſtemperature, pain, tumor, contuſion, or ſuch like, ſtirred up by antecedent cauſes: Of this cemeth matter either good or bad; that which is good is of a mean ſubſtance, between thin and thick, white light equal, and not ſtinking: that which is bad is thin, glewy, much in quantity, ſwarriſh, black, pale, ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
               <p>If the diſtemperature of the Ulcer be hot, it is known by heat, redneſs, and relief by cold things. In a cold diſtemperature, there is not ſo much redneſſe, and it is caſed by hot things. Whether the diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature be moiſt or dry, the eye will diſcover.</p>
               <p>The cure of an Ulcer ſimply conſidered, muſt be performed by Medicines which have a digeſtive, mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dificative, incarnative, and cicatricing quality: of which ſort, I have alieady treated in the cure of Wounds.</p>
               <p>I ſhall onely now briefly treat of the Diſtempers, Adjuncts and Accidents of Ulcers.</p>
               <p>Firſt, let the ſymptome be removed: if it be hot, conſider whether it be with matter, or without; if with matter, whether it be Sanguine, or Cholerick.
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:115825:221"/> If it be a Sanguine Diſtemper, let bloud, obſerve a ſlender and cooling. Diet and Medicines. If the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be Cholerick purge Choller, obſerve a cooling Diet, and uſe cool Medicines. If there be a hot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperature without matter, neither purge nor bleed, but uſe cooling Medicines; as Unguentum Album, Diapompholigos, Rubrum, Camphora, Ex Plumbo, and Ex Ceruſſa, and ſuch others. Alſo, Roſe-Water, the Juyce or Water of Nightſhade, Houſleek, Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>If the Diſtemperature be cold, purge Flegme if it abound, and uſe Diet and Medicines, which doth heat and dry inwardly: Outwardly apply warming Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Unguentum de Althea, or Unguentum Citri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num: waſh it with warm wine, or the decoction of Wormwood, Mint, Hyſop, Calamint, Origan, Roſema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Peny-royal, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>If the Ulcer be too moiſt, dry it with Unguentun Pompholigos, de Plumbo, de Ceruſſa, de gratia dei, de Calce.</p>
               <p>If it be too dry, let his Diet and Medicines be moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening; as Baſilicon de Pice, Diachylon, &amp;c. Having removed the Diſtemperature, go on gradually to the Cure; if the matter be crude digeſt, having digeſted it, mundifie it; having ſo done, in carnate it: and laſtly, cicatriſe it.</p>
               <p>If a Tumor doth accompany the Ulcer, you may from the Chapters aſoregoing, be able to judge what the Humour is, which is the cauſe thereof. You muſt evacuate it by bloud-letting, purging, thin and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Diet and Medicines: The Chapters aforegoing will inform you, whether it be drawn thither by the part if ſelf, or ſent from other parts, or from the whole body: Nor you need not go any farther, nor
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:115825:222"/> I trouble my ſelf to preſcribe Medicines, to repel and diſcuſs the Tumors, the aforenamed Chapters being ſufficiently furniſhed.</p>
               <p>A contuſed Ulcer muſt be nouriſhed with Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines moiſtening and ingendring good matter, and the Cure may be performed by the means preſcribed for the Cure of a contuſed Wound.</p>
               <p>If the Ulcer be accompanied with proud fleſh, it muſt be taken off by an Inciſion Knife, Cautery, or hot Sciſſers, &amp;c. or by cotroſive Medicines: the gentler ſort are Burnt Allum, Hermodactyls with Tartar, Date Stones burnt, Aqua vitae with Sulphur, Unguentum Apoſtolorum, Nettle-ſeed, the Flower of Braſs, Burnt Braſs, Serpentaria, the Root of Aſphodels, &amp;c. Of a ſtronger ſort are theſe, the Powder of Mercury, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum Aegyptiacum, or Apoſtolorum, with Natural Verdegreaſe. Of the ſtronger ſort are, Quicklime, Red Vitriol, Burnt Vitriol, Mercury ſublimate: Of theſe may many Compounds be made, which for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſake I omit.</p>
               <p>If the Lips of the Ulcer be hard, ſoften it with mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying Medicines, made of the fat of a Gooſe, Hen, Duck, Lion, Bear, Calf, Oxe, or the like; the Oyl of Lillies, Sweet Almonds, Earth-Worms, Foxes, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum Baſilicon, Diachilon, and Emplaſtrum de Mucilaginibus. If it be ſo hard that it will not yield to Medicine, make uſe of In ciſion, Cautery, or of the aforenamed corroſive Medicines.</p>
               <p>If the Bone be defiled by an Ulcer, take it off with a Scaling Inſtrument, or an hot Iron: after you have looſed the Scale, the firſt three days apply Oyl of Roſes, and the White of an Egg warm: the next three days, the yolk of an Egg, and Oyl of Roſes; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that with Butter and Hony.

               <p>If Worms breed in the Ulcer, take away the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and putrefaction whereof they are ingendred; kill the Worms with the Juyces, or Decoction of Wornewood, Centory, Eupatorium, Wormwood, and ſuch like, bitter Hearbs.

               <p>THE firſt thing herein confiderable, is the matter offending; what part of the body is afflicted, and which is the beſt way to evacuate the peccant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. The matter offending is either Flegm, Water, Choller, or Melancholy. Purging Simples work gently or ſtrongly, thoſe that work gently onely, are to be given to weak Bodies; the ſtrongeſt, to ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger perſons. Be well adviſed of the offending hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour before you purge, leaſt inſtead of helping, you weaken Nature. Before you take a purge, let the Humours be prepared by ſome Medicines proper for the purpoſe, eſpecially if Flegm or Melancholy be the humour you would purge. Prepare the body before with Medicines, that are attenuating and cutting, and let your Purge be made up with it. The next Book will furniſh you with variety of altering and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Medicines.</p>
               <p>It is a matter of conſequence to conſider what part of the body is afflicted, and to form your Purges accordingly. If the remote parts of the body be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; as the Head, Arms, Feet, and the like, let your Purge be made up into a hard form as Pills; that by their long ſtay in the body, they may be the better able to draw the humours from thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>If the oftending humour lye in the Bowels, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent parts, uſe liquid Medicines: and in all theſe
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:115825:223"/> look not upon the multitude of Ejections, but of the matter ejected.</p>
               <p>If the humours lye in the Tunicle of the Stomach, a Vomit is neceſſary, and in many caſes more it is a good Revulſion; but take them not without advice from an able Phyſitian.</p>
               <p>If the Purge work not at all, give warm Broath, and Poſſet Drink, and if the Purge were ſtrong, give a Cliſter. If it work too ſtron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of Distilled Waters.</hi>
               </head>
               <div type="introduction">
                  <p>COld or ſimple Diſtilled Waters are drawn out of Hearbs, Flowers, Fruits, and Roots; all which ought to be diſtilled when they are in their greateſt vigour, and ought to be gathered in a dry day about Noon. The common way is to diſtil them in a Peuter Still: the Water thus diſtilled is (of all Medicines) the weakeſt, yet is of uſe in mixing them with other Medicines, that they may be the better taken. To avoid burning, put fifted Aſhes under the Veſſel, which holds the Hearbs, and give a gentle fire.</p>
                  <p>But to make the Water have more ſmell and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Hearbs, do thus: Take what green Hearb, and Roots, or Flowers freſh gathered, if you pleaſe bruiſe them, and mix with them ſome Leaven, and let them ſtand cloſe covered four or five days, then diſtil them as aforeſaid. To make it ſtronger, do thus: When you have diſtilled any Hearb as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid in a common Still, by putting a Paper under them to prevent burning and drying the Cake over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much: Put the Water and the Cake together into a hot Still, or Alembick, and let them ſtand warm 24 hours; then diſtil them, and if you would have the Water yet ſtronger, pour this Water upon more Cakes, and do as before; and if there be any Oyl up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of the Water ſeparate it, thus you ſhall have a very ſtrong and excellent Water. Or if you
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:115825:225"/> perform this diſtillation in a glaſſe Gourd, in a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Balneo, that is in warm-water, your water will be very good, and far excelling the water diſtilled the common way. To know the virtue and uſe of theſe waters, you muſt find the virtue of the hearb by ſome Herball, or Hiſtory of Plants and Hearbs. If you would have a diſtilled water out of flowers, which ſhall retaine the ſmell of the flower, do thus. Take Roſes, Violets, Honey-ſuckles, or what other flower you would diſtill, pick them, being firſt gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a fair, and Sunſhine day, infuſe a handfull or two of them into two quarts of the beſt White-wine, the ſpace of half an hour, not much longer (leſt with the ſubtill ſpirit, the carthy part alſo come forth): then take them forth, and infuſe in the ſame Wine the ſame quantity of flowers; do ſo eight or ten times. Then put the Wine into a glaſſe body or Gourd, and cloſe the joynts well with Lutement, and diſtill it in a gentle Balneo, or place your Glaſſe over the Vapour of hot water, that ſo the ſubrill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit only may aſſend. By this meanes you ſhall have a water of a moſt fragrant odour;</p>
                  <p>You may diſtill a water ſtrong of the vegetable out of dried hearbs thus: Take of any hearb dried (or ſeed or root if you pleaſe) a pound, put it into twelve pints of clear ſpring water, let it ſtand warm as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, then diſtill it in a hot Still or Alembick, to this diſtilled water add more dried hearbs, and diſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as often as you pleaſe, till your water become like a Spirit. Or if you add White-Wine to the hearb, it will be the ſtronger, which leads me to the diſtylled waters, preſcribed by the Colledge of Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; of one of which I ſhall ſet down the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſtilling, and content my ſelf in deſcribing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115825:226"/> the virtues and quantity to be uſed of the reſt.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of Syrups.</hi>
               </head>
               <div type="introduction">
                  <p>OF ſyrups there are three ſorts; ſyrrups made by infuſion, juyce and decoction; ſyrrups made by infuſion are made of flowers, and ſuch flowers, as ſoon looſe both colour and ſtrength by boyling, as Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, Roſes, Clove-gilly-flowers, Peach-flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they are thus made. Having picked your flowers, to every pound add three pints of water made boyling hot, put them into a Pewter-pot with a cloſe cover, and keep it hot twelve hours. If you would make your ſyrrup very ſtrong, put in more freſh flowers as often as you pleaſe; having ſtrained it out, put the liquor into a Pewter-Baſon, and to every pint add two pound of fine Sugar; put it upon a Chaffin-diſh of Coales, and melt it, ſtirring and ſcumming it till the Sugar be perfectly melted without boyling.</p>
                  <p>Secondly to make a ſyrrup of the juyce of an hearb, you muſt make choice of ſuch hearbs as are full of juyce; then beat it in a ſtone Morter, preſſe out the juyce, put it over the fire and clarifie it, (that is, ſcum it as long as any ſcum ariſe) then boyle it till a quarter of it be conſumed; to a pint of this add a pound of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, boyling it to a ſyrrup and ſcumming of it. You may know when it is enough if you coole a little in a ſpoon. After this manner you may make ſyrrup of Wormwood ſimple, of Betony, Bugloſſe, Borrage,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:115825:231"/> Chamomell, Carduus, Endive, Succory, Strawberryes, Funtitory, ground Jvy, St. Johns-wort, Mercury, Mouſ-care, Plantane, Purſlane, Apples, Raſpberies, Sage, Scabius, Scordium, Houſleek, Colts-foot, and ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; and when you have done ſo, and would know what they are good for, ſee the virtue of the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Syrrups made by decoction, for the moſt part are compounds; though you may make Syrrups of Simples by decoction: the operation is thus; Take of what hearb, root, flower, or ſeed you pleaſe, and bruiſe it a little, if you make a Syrrup of roots, or wherein there are many roots, let the roots macerate in the water twenty four houres; then add the hearbs, and the reſt, and boyle it, till half the water he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, then let it ſtand; and when it is almoſt cold, ſtrain it through an hypoeras-bag without preſſing: to every pint of the decoction, add one pound of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and boyle it till it comes to the thickneſſe of a Syrrup or new hony. After this manner, the moſt part of the Syrrups following are made, except they be made of flowers or juyces. Take this for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: <hi>Take of common Worm-wood meanly dry, half a pound, red Roſes two ounces, Indian ſpicknard three drachms, old White-wine, and juyce of Quinces, of each two pound and an half, ſteep them a whole day in an Earthen Veſſell, then boyle them gently, ſtrain it, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding two pound of Sugar, boyle it into a Syrrup accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to art.</hi>
                  </p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Preſerves, Conſerves, Sugars, and Lozenges.</hi>
               </head>
               <div type="introduction">
                  <p>Preſerves are made of Roots, Barks, Fruits, and Flowers: And firſt of Roots; Take of what Root you pleaſe, ſcrape it very clean, and if there be any Pith therein take it out; boil them in Spring Water (or in Roſe-Water, if you can afford it) till they be ſoft: then take them out, and to a pint of the Liquor add a pound of white Sugar, boil it to the thickneſs of a Syrup: then put in the Root, and let it boil a little, then put it into a glaſs, or a glaſſed pot, and keep it for your uſe. So you may preſerve the Roots of Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica, Acorus, Burrage, Bugloſs, Succory, Elecampane, Eringo, Ginger, Burnel, Satyrion, Comphry, Zedoary, the ſtalks of Artichokes, Angelica, Burs, Lettice, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be quite ripe; making this difference, that whereas before you took out the Pith of the Roots, you muſt of theſe make uſe of none but the Pith.</p>
                  <p>In like manner you may preſerve Barks; as Citron Pills, the Pills of Lemons and Or anges, and the green Rind of Walnuts, <hi>viz.</hi> Take of the exterior, or outmoſt
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:115825:244"/> yellow skin; then boyl it as before, till it be tender, make a Syrup, and preſerve it.</p>
                  <p>You may preſerve Fruits as you did the former, <hi>viz.</hi> Pare and quarter them, and take out the Oore; boil them till they be tender, and do as you are before taught.</p>
                  <p>Another way is this: Pate, quarter, and take out the Core of ſome; of others pull off the outward skin, and pull out the ſtones: take their weight in Sugar and diſſolve it, put in the fruits and let them boyl a little. Thus may you preſerve Apples, Peares, Quinces, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricocks, Plums, Peaches, Citrons, Myrabolans, Nutmegs, Grapes, Barberryes, Cherryes, Cornells, &amp;c. or of any of theſe fruits you may preſerve the pulp, by boyling them till they be tender, then pulp them through a Sieve: boyle the pulp gently till the water be conſumed, then add its equall weight in Sugar, and boyle it to its due thickneſſe. Though flowers are ſeldom, yet they may be preſerved thus: Take a glaſſe, broad both at the top and bottome, firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the bottome of the glaſſe with fine Sugar; then cover the Sugar with the flowers you would preſerve, lay them even and ſmooth, then cover them with Sugar, and that againe with flowers, till your glaſſe be ſull; Tye a Paper over the top, and you will have a pleaſant preſerve.</p>
                  <p>The virtue of Preſerves you may eaſily gather, if you conſider the nature of the root, ſtalk, fruit, bark or flower preſerved; they are of great uſe in phyſick, and many times welcome to ſick people; but are moſt commonly uſed at banquets,</p>

                  <head>Conſerves.</head>
                  <p>Conſerves are made either of hearbs or flowers: if you make your conſerve of herbs, you muſt take only the tender tops and leaves; and beat them in a ſtone Morter, when they are beaten pretty ſmall, add to them their treble weight in Sugar, beat them very well, you cannot beat them too much till (if you eate it) it feels not rough in your mouth: then put it into earthen pots well glazed, and keep it for your uſe.</p>
                  <p>Conſerves of flowers are done in the ſame manner, only remember to do them whilſt they are freſh, pick them clean, and cur off the whites.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſay no more of Conſerves, but leave the virtue and uſe of them to the ingenious.</p>

                  <p>AS there are of other Medicines, ſo there are of Oyls, both ſimple and compound: Simple Oyls are either by expreſſion, or infuſion and decoction: Oyls by Expreſſion, are drawn out of Fruits or Seeds; as out of ſweet and bitter Almonds, the Seed of Rope and Flax; by firſt beating them in a Stone-Morter, and preſſing out the Oyl in a Preſs.</p>
                  <p>Simple Oyls, by infuſion and decoction, are thus made: Take the Hearbs or Flowers, of which you would make your Oyl; beat them to two or three handfuls; pour on a pint of oyl, put them in an Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then pot, and cover it with a paper tyed about the top, and ſet it in the Sun a fortnight: then heat it by the fire, and preſs out the hearbs: then put in as many hearbs as you did at firſt; do as before, as often as you ſee good, to make your Oyl ſtrong enough: then boyl it gently, till the vittue come forth of the hearbs, and then ſtrain it, and reſerve it for your uſe. In this manner is made the Oyls of Roſes, Dill, Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil, Melilot, Lillies, Violets, &amp;c.
